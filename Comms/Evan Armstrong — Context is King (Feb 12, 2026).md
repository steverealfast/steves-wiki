# Context is King: Notes on the SaaSacre

## Overview

Armstrong argues that a $300 billion market capitalization loss in software companies isn't about AI making software obsolete — rather, it reveals a fundamental restructuring of enterprise software economics into three distinct layers with different value propositions.

## The Valuation Problem

Three structural factors explain declining SaaS company valuations:

1. **Slower Growth**: Top-quartile public SaaS companies now grow slower than bottom-quartile firms did in 2016. Public SaaS growth "halved from 36% to 17% since 2023."

2. **Worse Margins**: AI-native applications operate at 50-65% gross margins versus traditional SaaS's 75-85%. Each AI use carries marginal costs, fundamentally altering economic logic.

3. **Decreasing Switching Costs**: LLMs make data migration easier. "Switching costs are moved to data access and organizational context," reducing traditional SaaS platform stickiness.

## The Three-Layer Stack

**Layer 1 — Systems of Record** (databases, financial ledgers, compliance systems): Remain essential but stop commanding premium multiples. Like Oracle and SAP, they're sticky but face commoditization.

**Layer 2 — Point Solutions** (analytics, project management): The "true SaaSacre zone." Individual user-facing tools become vulnerable to AI-generated alternatives since "generating code is commoditized."

**Layer 3 — The Context Layer** (NEW): The institutional knowledge directing AI agents — who accesses what data, what sequences complete workflows, organizational decision logic. This represents "the most important software in the stack" because it compounds. Each agent execution generates traces improving future performance.

## Context Layer Characteristics

Unlike markdown documentation, true context "doesn't live in a document. It emerges from thousands of workflows executed over time." It captures nuanced organizational knowledge: which deals stall at legal review, which salespeople skip discovery calls for existing customers.

## Economic Migration Pattern

Armstrong invokes Clayton Christensen's Law of Conservation of Attractive Profits: when one layer commoditizes, adjacent layers de-commoditize. As databases and applications become cheap token-generation costs, value concentrates where "the main bottleneck" exists — currently the connection between AI model training and agent execution.

The context layer "doesn't replace existing software spend. It replaces coordination overhead that companies just accepted." It extracts value from payroll budgets, not IT budgets, funding roles previously called "overhead."

## Competitive Landscape

Multiple players pursue context layer dominance:

- **ServiceNow**: Holds workflow penetration and process definitions across organizations
- **Notion**: Controls institutional knowledge for documentation-centric companies
- **Glean**: Evolving enterprise search into organizational context
- **OpenAI Frontier**: Building semantic operating systems connecting data and deploying accumulating agents
- **Anthropic Cowork**: Deploying capable agents bypassing application layers

The unanswered question: "Does the context layer get owned by the company that already holds the knowledge, or the company that builds the most capable agents?"

## Conclusion

The "SaaSacre" signals not software's decline but rather value migration. Armstrong concludes: "Context is king" — the institutional meaning layer becomes software for the first time, capturing margins SaaS lost.
