## Full Transcript

**Sidin:** Hey. Man.

**Steven:** Amen.

**Sidin:** Hey. What's happening?

**Steven:** How you doing?

**Sidin:** Are you doing? Tired. Man. What's up with you? What's happening?

**Steven:** Tired. Man.

**Sidin:** Yeah. God. Tired. I was talking to some guy I advise, and they have three co founders. And this guy is supposed to be their US GTM co founder.

**Steven:** Okay?

**Sidin:** And by the end, he was like, dude, I don't understand the product at all. Can you just explain it back to me? So it's just like at some level, there are commonalities. All the AI guys are basically doing the same thing, but very draining. So, shall I take you through some of the thoughts I had, or do you have any specific things you want to talk about?

**Steven:** I want you to take me through your thoughts. I am keen to know two things. Specifically one your conversation with EQT. And also the Accenture bit, because both are kind of in a conversation, things that's happening on our customer side as well.

**Sidin:** Okay? So I'll recap those two things quickly. Accenture. I went out with my wife and her kind of her friend circle. Mostly colleagues, ex colleagues, for dinner. Is really good. And turns out that one of her friend's husbands is the head of IT for Accenture Tech for Accenture across UK and Ireland. Very senior guy. And. He said, essentially every six to 12 weeks, they're acquiring a company. And he's their acquisitions guy. He's just constantly looking to build. They have a pipeline of AI stuff that they're trying to acquire. And I didn't probe too much because I'm planning to meet him again in a couple of weeks time, but might be an interesting person for you to speak. To. At least you know what's being acquired. And, yeah. He was like, what we can do in house, we do in house. If we can, we just acquire. I mean, there's no point in trying to build AI capabilities. And how, if it doesn't exist?

**Steven:** Yeah. No point.

**Sidin:** And he said, going full speed ahead. So I thought, okay, might be good just to not acquire us, but at least figure out, okay, what do we need to do to look sexy for you? In 12 months.

**Steven:** Yeah.

**Sidin:** EQT. I was speaking to somebody called Sophie, was head of their comms and helping their portfolio companies, the venture side, portfolio companies with comms and stuff. But I think they're doing a new fund and they want to kind of completely revamp the way EQT Ventures does their marketing and internal comms. And stuff. External comms all of that.

**Steven:** Okay?

**Sidin:** So Kaushik at EQT put me in touch with her, so I'm speaking to her. Not next week, the week after, when she's come back. Coming back from leave. Because she wants. They want to kind of completely revamp the way they do comms. The problem they have is a lot of their comms is directed by EQT, which is much more slopy. Sweden led. But EQT Ventures wants to be much more dynamic. Early.

**Steven:** So you dropped Kaushik's team? You know Kaushik?

**Sidin:** I know I'm really well.

**Steven:** We are pitching him for portfolio company work on Monday.

**Sidin:** Yeah, I know him really well.

**Steven:** Okay? So actually, conversation with EQT is previously we have been introduced to them through Peak and this was when we were focusing solely on Salesforce. We showed them what we can do, et cetera, and they were like, look, we have no net new business where we can use you guys for implementation. But we'll come back to you after Sidhu's recent tweets on the whole boardroom deal, et cetera. They reach back out to us to say that we want to just continue our conversation. And we kind of harp down balloon about doing this deal, et cetera. So actually, the point of this conversation. I don't know why he's called Kaushik to the call. We're not looking to raise from EQT Ventures. We actually want to get access to one or two of their portfolio companies to actually do that whole AI transformation bit and use them as a distribution node. So any guidance on that call would be also helpful to us. If I can take you through what we are pitching them on either tomorrow, day after for the Monday call and then you can just give us some more flavour on that. That would be really helpful.

**Sidin:** So I will tell you two three things I know about Kaushik. So I know Kaushik. Oddly enough, Steve, I started this because of Kaushik. What I do now.

**Steven:** All right.

**Sidin:** So, because in September, I just left Clarissa. I was thinking, what do I do? I went to his office. He said, come talk to me. He said, look, I have lots of portfolio companies within and outside. They all struggle with comms. They're all really smart guys, but cannot communicate to save their lives, often can't. Talk about their business. He said, I'll give you a couple of portfolio companies. But there's a huge demand for this. Very few people do it in the US they're very expensive. So he said you should start.

**Steven:** Yeah.

**Sidin:** He immediately gave me a couple of his portfolio companies. One worked out. I still do work for them. The other one is, like, in the air, and now I'm talking to a third one. In fact, I spoke to them next week. So he's been. So I speak to him, like, once a week. He gives me tips and tricks and talk to these guys and so on. So what I know about Kaushik, I'll tell you. The guy does a lot of work with fintech companies he's obsessively focused on. Because he's ex Stripe. So he has a lot of info into payments companies. So the companies I know is directly dealing with his Stacks AI, which is building AI end of month closing software.

**Steven:** Okay? Yeah. Yeah.

**Sidin:** PayRails, which is a full payment, full stack payment thing for you to pay for anybody to anybody globally. Largely B2B product. Paid AI which is building AI monetization to agentic building and monetization tools. If you're a SaaS company, you deploy agents. How do you bill for their work? So he does a lot of work in deploying AI, using AI for payments, using AI to figure out how much work your agents have done. All of that stuff. Super non bullshit. Very, very sharp. And I know he's aggressively following deals. Now, I don't know how many of them are pre AI or post AI. The ones I talk to are all using AI in some form. But I also know the other portfolio companies is invested in is in Beside.

**Steven:** Okay?

**Sidin:** There's a company called Beside. There's a company called Marvel X. And he's also putting in money into a robotics company and a few other stuff. He does a lot of stuff for them because I think he's now driving ventures out of London. But he's very keen on payments and fintech. If I get any more. If anything else comes up in my meeting notes, I'll tell them to.

**Steven:** Okay? Please. And I'd love to run you through how we're approaching the pitch because, again, this ties in directly to how you're thinking about comms.

**Sidin:** Yeah. Cool. So let me. So what I did was for me, the two main questions were. One, you said one Sidhu said which is. Sidhu was like, look, what do we have to do? For an IT services guy to acquire us in 12 to 24 months. Okay, and the other thing, which is you said is, look, we are doing 30k deals. We are doing 1 million deals. How do we make sense of both of these things? This was on my mind. So what I did over the last couple of days was Monday and Tuesday was I was looking at completely what is happening in the IT services space right now. In terms of data, productivity, all of that stuff. Okay, you might know all of this, Steve, but I'm going to repeat everything to you because I think.

**Steven:** Oh, no, it's fine.

**Sidin:** A couple of very interesting things is that.

**Steven:** By the way, do you have Fathom.

**Sidin:** I use Granola?

**Steven:** Is it recording?

**Sidin:** Yeah.

**Steven:** Will you send me the recording? Then.

**Sidin:** Send it to you. So it'll send you the transcript. I'll give you notes as well. So what I did was I said, okay, what is the state of especially Indian IT Services? From what I realized from the Huron call, it's not just an Indian thing, but so very interesting thing, Steve, is that largely for the last 10 years, one big trend is that revenue per employee has been flat. For all of them. It only pumps up when they let a bunch of people go, but they almost always end up hiring a bunch of people again. So revenue per employees generally stuck at a particular number. And largely for every million dollars of revenue, these guys need to hire 20 to 25, 25 to 30 employees for every million dollars of revenue. It has been flat, regardless of tech, regardless of whatever, this number has been flat. And they've slowly started bringing up in analyst calls that we need to improve our revenue per employee. Thing is they don't know how to do it. They are saying we'll use AI now what are they using AI for? They are like, we'll give everybody Cursor. We'll give everybody Devin. That is not going to. I don't think that's going to actually improve revenue per employee at all.

**Steven:** So that's a point that I also figured, which is to say that it's not a tooling or a procurement problem. It's a workflow problem. And the other bit. I think you said this to me or I read this somewhere else. Is that your math on when you're saying that for every million dollars of net new revenue that they had, they got to add 20 to 30 people? And when they don't do that. The what ends up happening. Is that the reason why they have these prolonged projects? Is because they have a very big bench. So they can absorb the cost of this project. Internally. Right. So their margins always look flat or look marginally improving. If they cut a bunch of people this month or next, this quarter or whatnot, margin goes up slightly, there's some more ROI on their stock price. And that's rinse, repeat. That's how they keep working this.

**Sidin:** Exactly correct. So this is one important trend. So this is one on my thought, right? RPE and employees flat. They've tried all kinds of things. They're throwing Devin at it. It will not help. RPE is flat. More interestingly, what is happening again, I'm looking at analyst calls, I'm looking at numbers and so on. These guys thrived off the fact that they had a large number of 90% plus were multiple year, million dollar, multimillion dollar projects that were renewed very rarely. So they built entire sales presales, development, design, whatever orgs to serve customers like this. Which is we will sign a 30 million, 100 million, whatever million dollar deal and we don't need to worry about it for five years, 10 years, whatever. All of these guys were built. This is completely changing the average deal. Sizes are coming down. Two things are happening. One is average deal size is coming down. Second, a lot of these customers are now saying that I want to renew every year. These guys are not designed for annual renewals. They have. Their sales teams can't function. Annual renewables, their internal documentation, procurement process, doing the paperwork, security assessment. None of it is designed for fast turnover. Renewals. It's just not designed. And it's becoming a huge problem. And they've also admitted it. I think Mahindra or one of these other guys said that 25% of our deals are now up for frequent renewals and that number is going to be. So what's now happened? Is, like I said, this is kind of like this barbell shaped thing where they still have a lot of legacy deals that are old. But they know that all of these deals will no longer give you five year renewals. They're all going to change into annual or two year renewal deals. That important to keep in mind. Second thing. And I was talking to a guy, a friend of mine, school father. He is a sales engineer with Snowflake. So he was saying one of the problems they're having is they've signed these multimillion dollar deals with Morgan Stanley. He comes to Bangalore, he goes to Chennai. He does like he's that guy. He's Morgan Stanley Snowflake. He said, the problem now is Morgan Stanley is coming to them and saying, you've got AI now. Do this 150k project for us. Do this 300k project for us. He said boss, we are not designed to do 150k 300k project on profit. It will lose money for us because we are all. Our entire org is designed to sign and deliver on 3 million dollar deals 30 million dollar deals.

**Steven:** Is that. Is that baked into the way that they bake their teams and the leverage ratio that they're currently operating in?

**Sidin:** It's not. They have to actually do it as a. They do it on vibes right now, is what he said. He said, this is not baked into the contracts we have right now.

**Steven:** No, what I'm saying is that why can't they service 150k deals?

**Sidin:** Because his point is it needs requirements gathering. It needs to be configured. Somebody has to do the testing, and then you have to deploy it and then give it to them, he said. All of our steps are very expensive to do this.

**Steven:** Okay?

**Sidin:** Because, again, I didn't go into super detail. But his point was that we are designed as an org to look at multimillion dollar deals. So suddenly I can't wake up a team of 7 people to evaluate for a 150k 300k deal. Customers are expecting AI do it quickly. Also customers expectation is that look, if you do this 300k deal from me, a 3 million dollar deal will come afterwards somewhere else in Morgan.

**Steven:** Okay? Yeah.

**Sidin:** Stanley, so I can't afford to say no also.

**Steven:** Yeah.

**Sidin:** What's happening? Is that like I said? What? Therefore, in my thinking, what does an IT services company have to look like, say, five years from now? Just a number. Two years, three years, whatever. One. The barbell is going to even out completely. You're going to have deals from three, let's say $30,000 to $300 million. You're going to have deals of all sizes. Customers are going to expect you to deliver all of these.

**Steven:** Yeah.

**Sidin:** You have to be profitable at every price point. Making your engineers move faster is not going to help because your sales team is not going to be able to move fast enough on a 300k deal or 30k deal because you're going to move at the 30 million dollar deal. So therefore. The new metric I'm thinking of, Steve, is that it's no longer going to be revenue per employee has to increase. Like, I don't think Infosys is going to survive if it keeps its RPE at this level, it has to double.

**Steven:** Yeah.

**Sidin:** Huron's RPE will reduce.

**Steven:** Why? Why?

**Sidin:** Again. My thinking is that because their deal sizes are also going to get reduced.

**Steven:** Okay?

**Sidin:** Because.

**Steven:** All right. Okay. Okay. Got it.

**Sidin:** You see, my in fact, my thinking is these two businesses are going to converge. The consulting and the IT implementation business are going to converge. They're going to hit a particular level of RPE at some point in between because companies are going to tell them, look, implementation is easy for you. Why am I paying you a premium.

**Steven:** Yeah.

**Sidin:** These guys are going to say, look, whatever, right? So my thinking is RPE again. Very early thought, Steve. But RPE has to increase number one. RPE has to increase number two. Whether it is 30k or 300k, you need to be able to run the deal from top to bottom profitably. Irrespective of the size that a deal comes to you with. Okay? Just to park it in your head. My thinking is, therefore your metric is no longer any of these — the metric is friction per unit of revenue. I have to minimize my friction per unit of revenue.

**Steven:** Okay, I like that. Okay?

**Sidin:** For every $1 of revenue my company makes my friction — cost of selling, cost of compliance, cost of pre sales delivery. Everything has to come down to a minimum. You no longer can look at per engineer productivity. You have to look at the entire pipeline. Therefore you need a company — if you are going to build AI into your company. It is not enough to give Cursor or Devin to an engineer. You need to have an AI system that goes end to end across the company. You need an XO that can sit from top of the funnel, through the middle, through the bottom, all the way to the end. Your security guys have to use AI. Your legal guys have to use. You have to build it that way. None of these guys can build it this way because that is not how the teams are organized.

**Steven:** Yeah. Right.

**Sidin:** So your problem is actually a good problem because you're saying I can do a 30k deal profitably. I can do a 3 million deal profitably because XO is making me profitable for every unit of revenue.

**Steven:** Hell.

**Sidin:** Am I making sense to you?

**Steven:** Yeah, you are.

**Sidin:** Right. So my thinking is the IT services company of the future cannot say I will only be profitable at a certain price point. I have to minimize friction per unit of revenue across my entire org for every contract. It cannot happen at human scale. Your engineers will move faster. Your sales guys are like, boss. Okay, I don't have time. Your delivery case. My God, I'm stuck here. Everybody needs to move at that level of speed, and the only way to do that is to actually have an entire AI backbone that is built for the IT services industry. So when you go to somebody and say, I'm profitable at 30k and a 3 million. You are saying that I've solved for the friction per unit of revenue.

**Steven:** Stop. If I'm to extrapolate that thought process. Right. And I know this early, early days. How would you quantify friction? Per employee. Or per what? Friction per.

**Sidin:** Per unit of revenue.

**Steven:** Unit of revenue for an existing business. Like how. How would you put a number to it? Like, say, Infosys is at one. I'm at 0.5. Like, how to. How to think about that.

**Sidin:** I think the only way to think about, and I don't know, this might be a thing that already exists. Is that you need to start thinking of total cost of delivery. Like the way you calculate margins of. Margins of projects need to change.

**Steven:** Okay?

**Sidin:** Because right now Infosys is like, we'll spend a million dollars on presales and sales. Why? $30 million revenue. We will optimize for delivery cost.

**Steven:** Yeah.

**Sidin:** You can't do that anymore. Because customers are not going to accept that anymore. They're not going to accept the fact that these are the margins you're using. AI. Why are you not more profitable? Why do I ought to always come to — so my thinking is a total cost of delivering a unit of revenue has to come down. Again. I haven't like, there has to be a metric you need to come up with, but for me, friction is. The reason I can't tell you it's total cost is because it's a combination of time and money.

**Steven:** Dude, what you're saying is 100% on point, right? And I think a lot of it is. Maybe it's just listener's bias. But when you say that it has to be embedded across the entire workflow, most people start at pre sales and they end at delivery, right? You're talking about, dude? Every bit. Including legal.

**Sidin:** Yes.

**Steven:** Including getting your not just your SOWs through that same pipeline. But also your contract review, your SOW review, all of those things which would technically be a bottleneck, need to go through this, like, sausage making machine effectively. And so that you have the turnaround time, that you get back to the customer.

**Sidin:** Correct.

**Steven:** Is now no longer a friction point.

**Sidin:** That is so for me, total cost of friction. The reason I can't tell you a dollar. It's a company. It's actually a velocity of money thing. If you think of economics, it's a combination of money and time. Your legal guy can't take three months anymore. Yesterday, three days.

**Steven:** Yeah.

**Sidin:** Your security guy cannot take three days. Your compliance guy cannot take two months. All of this has to become faster. And you cannot make it faster by only making you by giving Devin to your engineers. Or Claude to your sales guys. You now have to have a system. Where? If I talk to you and you tell me when can you start? You ask. XO says you can start next week because the architect is on leave.

**Steven:** Yeah.

**Sidin:** That is the only way it will work.

**Steven:** I don't know whether you have access to this or you have. You. You. You've sort of got this through the grapevine. But. You talking about? Specific bottlenecks that traditionally exist, like compliance and security. For bottom line. For example, when we had to go through our compliance to see whether we were SOC 2 certified or whatever. The amount of documentation that they wanted would have been a minimum two month turnaround time. We gave it to them within two days. Right. So what you're saying is, like, really resonates with us. But these are all internal metrics that we have not found a way to come to the outside world either. In from like I'm thinking, look, if I'm raising a Series A, which idiotic venture investor gives a shit about this? Like, you'll be like, oh, you did it in two days. What? Does that even mean to me? Right. I don't know how to bridge that gap.

**Sidin:** Yeah.

**Steven:** To.

**Sidin:** No, no. I see completely what you mean. Because again, I was not thinking of the Ventures. I was like, if you were to go to an Infosys, or let's say, forget Infosys, we're going to go to.

**Steven:** Some. Yeah, this would. This would slap with like Huron, they would get it. Yeah, they would. They would get it instantly.

**Sidin:** Yes. In fact, I would say you need to raise some money. You need to raise enough money for Huron to acquire you, tactically speaking.

**Steven:** Yes.

**Sidin:** You need to raise. And for Huron, this is an existential challenge.

**Steven:** Yeah.

**Sidin:** Because all of these guys. So my thinking is, it's that all you have to prove is I can do a $30,000 project in three days at 70% margins, and I can do a 3 million dollar project in 30 days at a 70% margin. And you've proven your point. Beginning to end. And my thinking is, therefore, I was like, okay, why would Snowflake hire you? Right. Snowflake will hire you and say, boss, slowly start running this for our small projects and then roll it out for all our projects. Or you'd go to a Huron and say, boss, we're going to do this for ideally, you want to start vertically and go horizontally. You want to tell Huron? Okay. I can do this for one project, then one vertical. Then I can do it for all your verticals, because now the entire system talks to each other.

**Steven:** Yeah.

**Sidin:** But that is why they would acquire you. Because this is how they will change their stock price value. By saying that we are the same Huron. But now we've gone from Ambassador Car to, I don't know, Honda City. The same work, but much faster. Think of inventory turns of people.

**Steven:** Yeah.

**Sidin:** Old school manufacturing, right? This is for me. I was thinking like this. For me. Makes complete sense about why Real Fast is the way it does. You are not optimizing for deal size. You're optimizing deal friction.

**Steven:** And you are you. Basically, Sidhu has this analogy. You're applying the Industrial Revolution to software effectively. You're running Toyota or whatever those old school Japanese assembly line models in terms of just in time. Across the board.

**Sidin:** Correct. And the only way you can do that is by end to end AI implementation, not by selective AI. And it cannot be presale AI, CRM AI, staffing AI, developer AI. You will not get it.

**Steven:** Yeah. Yeah. It's got to be talking end to end.

**Sidin:** Correct. And that is what you guys are actually highlighting. I mean, this is. Again, I was really thinking about this. Therefore, if you can prove — I'm actually happy you got the Boardroom deal, because you're now proving that our thing scales. If I can do 30K and I can do 1 million. Finished now, boss. Who cares if it sales.

**Steven:** Dude, to be honest with you, that. That. That time compression that you're talking about, right, because you're effectively saying Boardroom had from last year till April to be able to do this. They shat the bed for the last nine months or ten months. Effectively bringing us in January for a delivery due in April. You crunched that original timeline into four already.

**Sidin:** Correct.

**Steven:** So, I mean, that. That is the one proof point that you've got, right?

**Sidin:** And therefore, when you go to. Again, like I said, an IT Services guy, a Huron guy, a consulting guy, will give you an end to end project based on this pitch. I mean, once you can show it to them. If you tell Huron. Look, boss, this is your. What is your org chart look like? This many people in sales, this many people in pre sales, this many people in legal, this many people in compliance. And you've hit this revenue? I can double this revenue with the same headcount. Why? Because my thing accelerates everybody's unit of work. Because for the VC guy, my thinking again. I'm thinking from an equity venture. I need to think a little bit more.

**Steven:** Yeah.

**Sidin:** The reason why this would be interesting for him is this is the right time for a lot of these guys to implement this in their company.

**Steven:** Means what? In whose company?

**Sidin:** Let's say you're an early stage company that EQT has put money in.

**Steven:** Yeah.

**Sidin:** How are you different from. Okay, you're building AI for your customer. Great. How are you different from any other startup? You're still having the same sales guys, you're still doing your pitch decks, you're still doing all of this stuff. You're saying XO will come and plug in fully. Do it now. Because tomorrow, when you have 100 million ARR. XO's learned you. Do you see what I mean? You need to get this in now. XO needs to be. I know. I'm productifying XO a little bit.

**Steven:** Yeah, yeah.

**Sidin:** Point is, XO needs to go in now at an early stage company. You can't. Don't do what Huron is doing. Because that's an AI transformation job.

**Steven:** Yeah.

**Sidin:** Transform now. Get it now. Again, the reason my thinking is a lot of these guys. How do you think about AI? AI in the way I build the product. So AI in the product. AI for — a customer uses AI. So, for example, I can be an AI built product that is a normal product. You see what I mean? So customer uses AI in my product. I use AI to build the product. You are saying I will use AI to run the company.

**Steven:** Yeah.

**Sidin:** And then you plug in whatever you want to. You put Devin, Cursor, whatever. XO will take care of all of that. XO then becomes the — this is my thinking. So if you go to a VC fund, you want to say boss, we can do this end to end for you. Again. This is connected to. If you remember our older conversation, which is tomorrow, if you go and buy an IT services company, what are you going to do?

**Steven:** Right.

**Sidin:** You are going to optimize for deal velocity and not deal size. I hope all of this is making sense to you. I know it's a very early draft of it.

**Steven:** Hello? Man, it's — do that. Friction. The friction per unit of work is just outstanding. Like, I think that's a really good way of putting it.

**Sidin:** Yes, that. Minimizing constantly. Otherwise, how can a team of 17 people sign a 1 million ARR deal? Why? How did you do it? You did it because you minimized friction at every stage within that process.

**Steven:** How do you articulate this as a potential external facing artifact. Like I would think that like without naming the name, you describe the situation and the context of the situation with the outcome of the million dollar deal as a case study for you to be able to use. Like having this as a case study to go to Huron with would be outstanding.

**Sidin:** Timeline. Don't make a case study.

**Steven:** Right.

**Sidin:** Tell Huron timeline. Day we first spoke to Boardroom. Day we signed the deal. What we did on every day. Because that is what shows speed. Case study. Everybody does, man. There should be a timeline. That should be what is cool about that, is how you show low friction. Day one, day zero, spoke to Boardroom. Day two, we sent a pitch. Day four, they came in to us. Day seven, we said. Day eight, sign. Day nine. Day 30 finished. Advance in our bank account.

**Steven:** Cool. I got what you're saying.

**Sidin:** Because you want to tell Huron two things, right? You want to tell Huron. Look, this is the speed at which we work.

**Steven:** Bro. I can't. I can't clone you. And there's, like, 100 things that I think. You can write and do and comms on where the books to put your focus, bro. Like. I mean, all of these things are equally very important.

**Sidin:** Make money. Yeah, let's do the money. See, the thing we want to tell Huron is this, right? Again, Boss, please excuse. Obviously, I'm getting passed on information, so I might be inaccurate on a bunch of these things. You want to tell Huron, boss? This is the speed at which we work. But also this is the speed at which you could be working. This is what you need to. For them to kind of understand a little bit, because I think that is where they're going to struggle. They'll be very good at teaching customers how to use AI. They'll be very good. They'll spin that story. But can Huron increase deal velocity? Can you put in — they don't like it. See, they will not like admitting this because consultants don't like saying that you can mass produce what we do. So you have to kind of couch it in some language. But essentially, that's the thing. You're tokenizing their competence and saying that, boss, stop spending all of these things. Get deal flow going quickly. Have a much more delivery driven organization. Again. My question to you is, how are you guys doing 30k profitably and 1 million profitably? Because of this.

**Steven:** Yeah. I mean. You're asking the right question. To us to sort of say that, like, this is the USP, right? I mean, I didn't think about it in that sense. Because you were profitable at 30k, you are going to be profitable at a mill. How? Obviously because of AI.

**Sidin:** Correct. And the reason this important is you are profitable at 30k because you're extremely delivery efficient.

**Steven:** Yeah.

**Sidin:** Or there are two slightly different metrics that is necessary to be profitable at different price points. You can be profitable at 30k by keeping manpower cost low.

**Steven:** Yes.

**Sidin:** You can be profitable at 1 million with another metric. I thought through this and I forgot what to do. No, you do the 30k. You are profitable by moving very, very quickly and finishing it off. Don't waste time. One million. You do very, very quickly by staffing it with the right people. You are saying now this is irrelevant to Real Fast. Real Fast is one way of working. It is profitable at every deal scale.

**Steven:** Right.

**Sidin:** Every deal size.

**Steven:** Right.

**Sidin:** And I will institutionalize this for any company I go to. Now Huron again. The thing is, I can turn this project around for you. I can turn this vertical around for you. I can turn the company around for you. Then your stock price goes up. Then the stock price suddenly looks more interesting. This is not a headcount story. It's not a fire people story. It's not a hire people story, nothing. It is. How can Rolex make a million watches every year and still charge you $5,000 for it? You are the Rolex of IT services companies.

**Steven:** You had to throw in a watch reference.

**Sidin:** No, but that's the idea. That is the Industrial Revolution. Man is like you said. I can mass produce 10 things, 100 things, million things, thousand things, whatever. I can mass produce all of it. Anyway, sorry, but my thinking was so today if I'm Infosys, what am I thinking? RPE has to go up. Deal sizes are going down. Bill is going to become very lopsided because I'm going to lose all of these long term deals. Every customer is going to come and say use AI, cut cost. I don't know how to do any of these things. I need full revamp of the way I do deal flow. Anyway, these are some thoughts. I'll think more about, like VC angle, how do we pitch it and acquire how do we pitch it and all of these things. But I'll also look at the EQT thing. But I would say, look, it should be very, very simple. IT services completely changed. The old metrics are gone. You can no longer keep large benches. You can no longer do any of these things. I mean, everything has to move faster. Sidhu used to say, a new employee needs to sell in two days. A new employee needs to write code in four days. You cannot have this by optimizing for AI locally. It has to be optimized for AI globally across your org. And that's how we have built as a company. And we build that this is scalable. We did it at 3,000, we did at 30K, we did at 300K, we did at 1 million. We're going to do it at 3 million. And that's the only way to do it. If Infosys wants to start thinking or forget Infosys — Huron also thinking about this. This is the way to think about it. And if you're a VC fund, what are they paying you for? They're paying you for to be acquired. I mean literally. That is your pitch. They are not paying for your P&L. Because you'll be constrained by the number of people you can get. Anyway, this is my general thought — you are optimizing for friction per unit of revenue. We need to figure out a way to term it better. But yeah.

**Steven:** I'm aligned with what you said. I'm going to use some of this into what our Huron narrative is because tomorrow we have that call with them, but it's a technical call. And I got you. You don't know this, but, like, tomorrow morning's call is a Salesforce heavy technical call. Where Sidhu and Paulmi will basically run the show on that. I spoke to Ravi today about a further meeting with their senior leadership, which might happen next week.

**Sidin:** Friday, right? No, next week.

**Steven:** No, no. Next week. Next week when he's back in the States. So I think tomorrow is just a gatekeeping thing to be like, is there any juice in what they are saying? And do we take it forward with the senior guys? And if they take it forward with the senior guys, then we'll need to do a little bit of iteration on this. So I'm going to take whatever notes you send me from this and, like, revamp that into my pitch.

**Sidin:** Correct.

**Steven:** To what we are selling to Huron. I'm going to block time with you on Friday, if you don't mind.

**Sidin:** No problem. No problem. Friday is good.

**Steven:** For what we are going to say to EQT because that'll give me my weekend to go back to doing some more work, depending on what you come back with.

**Sidin:** Also the reason also I thought this. I forgot to say is this also takes care of Salesforce. Because while Salesforce is relevant now, how does it matter? I will go wherever deals are because I know how to function at every deal size.

**Steven:** Yeah, yeah, it doesn't matter.

**Sidin:** And Salesforce is a tap of deals, so I'm going to tap into it.

**Steven:** Yeah. Sure.

**Sidin:** Cool. I hope this is useful. By the way, little.

**Steven:** Yeah, man. Very. Very.

**Sidin:** Because I'm thinking. Yeah, so that's what I was thinking. I was thinking the next Infosys does not look like Infosys.

**Steven:** No, it doesn't.

**Sidin:** Cool. Okay, I will speak to you on Friday. You send me the EQT already?

**Steven:** I'm around the same time.

**Sidin:** Yeah, I'll send you same time. I'll send you a calendar thing and EQT I'll look at the deck and stuff.

**Steven:** Yeah. We'll do.

**Sidin:** Cool. Okay. Thanks. Man.

**Steven:** Send me the notes from this now, please. Thanks.

**Sidin:** Right now. Bye.

**Steven:** Bye.
