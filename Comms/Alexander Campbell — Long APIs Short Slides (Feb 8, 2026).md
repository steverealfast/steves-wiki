# Long APIs, Short Slides: A Pair Trade for the AI Transition

## Core Thesis

Campbell argues the market is misclassifying software companies. The sector contains two fundamentally different business models responding oppositely to AI proliferation: human-facing UI software faces compression while infrastructure APIs benefit from increased bot consumption.

## The Air Pocket

Campbell begins with market mechanics. Stock prices reflect buyer-seller dynamics. Natural stock buyers are acquirers and companies conducting buybacks; natural sellers are issuers. Currently, companies face pressure to reduce buybacks and increase debt issuance to fund AI capex, creating downward pressure on multiples.

"The reason you look at the historical price of an asset is to develop a useful mental model" for buyer psychology, Campbell writes. This framework reveals why software stocks split into winners and losers.

## The Category Error

**Type 1: Software Humans Click On**
- Dashboards, CRMs, project management tools
- Examples: Salesforce, HubSpot, ServiceNow, Monday.com
- Threatened by AI replacing workers, reducing seat licenses

**Type 2: Software Bots Call (APIs)**
- Databases, event streams, authentication, monitoring
- Examples: Cloudflare, MongoDB, Datadog, Twilio, Snowflake
- Usage increases dramatically with AI agents

The distinction matters enormously. One human generates single sessions with dozens of API calls hourly. One AI agent generates "hundreds of API calls per minute," consuming orders of magnitude more infrastructure resources.

Market data confirms this bifurcation. Human-UI SaaS declined sharply while bot-infrastructure SaaS surged in 2025 returns.

## Not Software — Services

The real disruption targets IT outsourcing. "The entire IT outsourcing model is labor arbitrage" — hiring in India at $15/hour, billing American clients at $80/hour.

When Anthropic launched Cowork agents on February 3rd, Indian IT stocks crashed immediately:
- Infosys ADRs fell 8.4%
- Nifty IT dropped 6%
- Wipro fell 4.5%
- Cognizant dropped ~10%

Hiring data reveals structural collapse. India's Big 4 IT firms (TCS, Infosys, Wipro, HCL) historically hire 10,000+ people quarterly. TCS cut 11,000 employees in a single quarter while HCL remained flat. Revenue growth dropped to low single digits from historical 15-20% annual growth.

## The Pivot Problem

Accenture attempted pivoting to AI consulting, announcing $3 billion in AI bookings. Campbell dismisses this as unworkable for Indian outsourcers. "Selling 10,000 junior developers at $30/hour is a volume business. You need the bodies."

The infrastructure supporting labor arbitrage — massive campuses, training programs, pipeline management — cannot transform into elite consulting. "AI makes the entire model redundant," not just less profitable.

However, Campbell tempers the short thesis. Multi-year enterprise contracts with switching costs mean "revenue doesn't fall off a cliff" — instead it decays gradually over 12-24 months as contracts renew at lower headcount. Expect "eight quarters of consensus estimates getting trimmed by 2-3% each time."

## Investment Implications

The trade emerges clearly: long infrastructure APIs (consumption-based, benefiting from bot activity), short human-UI SaaS and IT services companies (facing creative destruction and labor displacement).
