Transcript:

Me: Hey. Man.
Them: Amen.
Me: Hey. What's happening?
Them: How you doing?
Me: Are you doing? Tired. Man. What's up with you? What's happening?
Them: Tired. Man.
Me: Yeah. God. Tired. I was talking to some guy I advise, and they have three co founders. And this guy is supposed to be their usgtm co founder.
Them: Okay?
Me: And by the end, he was like, dude, I don't understand the product at all. Can you just explain it back to me? So it's just like at some level, there are commonalities. All the air guys are basically doing the same thing, but very draining. So, shall I take you through some of the thoughts I had, or do you have any specific things you want to talk about?
Them: I want you to take me through your thoughts. I am keen to know two things. Specifically one your conversation with eqt. And also the accenture bit, because both are kind of in a conversation, things that's happening on our customer side as well.
Me: Okay? So I'll recap those two things quickly. Accenture. I went out with my wife and her kind of her friend circle. Mostly colleagues, ex colleagues, for dinner. Is really good. And turns out that one of her friend's husbands is the head of IT for Accenture Tech for Accenture across UK and Ireland. Very senior guy. And. He said, essentially every six to 12 weeks, they're acquiring a company. And he's their acquisitions guy. He's just constantly looking to build. They have a pipeline of AI stuff that they're trying to acquire. And I didn't probe too much because I'm planning to meet him again in a couple of weeks time, but might be an interesting person for you to speak. To. At least you know what's being acquired. And, yeah. He was like, what we can do in house, we do in house. If we can, we just acquire. I mean, there's no point in trying to build AI capabilities. And how, if it doesn't exist?
Them: Yeah. No point.
Me: And he said, going full speed ahead. So I thought, okay, might be good just to not acquire us, but at least figure out, okay, what do we need to do to look sexy for you? In 12 months.
Them: Yeah.
Me: EEQP. I was speaking to somebody called Sophie, was head of their comms and helping their portfolio companies, the venture side, portfolio companies with comms and stuff. But I think they're doing a new fund and they want to kind of completely revamp the way QT Ventures does their marketing and internal comms. And stuff. External comes all of that.
Them: Okay?
Me: So Cauchy ca dqt put me in touch with her, so I'm speaking to her. Not next week, the week after, when she's come back. Coming back from leave. Because she wants. They want to kind of completely revamp the way they do comms. The problem they have is a lot of their comms is directed by eqt, which is much more slopy. Sweden led. But EQT Ventures wants to be much more dynamic. Early.
Them: So you dropped Kaushik's team? You know Kaushik?
Me: I know I'm really well.
Them: We are pitching him for portfolio company work on Monday.
Me: Yeah, I know him really well.
Them: Okay? So actually, conversation with EQT is previously we have been introduced to them through Peak and this was when we were focusing solely on Salesforce. We showed them what we can do, et cetera, and they were like, look, we have no net new business where we can use you guys for implementation. But we'll come back to you after Sidhu's recent tweets on the whole boardroom deal, et cetera. They reach back out to us to say that we want to just continue our conversation. And we kind of harp down balloon about doing this deal, et cetera. So actually, the point of this conversation. I don't know why he's called Kaushik to the call. We're not looking to raise from eqt ventures. We actually want to get access to one or two of their portfolio companies to actually do that whole AI transformation bit and use them as a distribution node. So any guidance on that call would be also helpful to us. If I can take you through what we are pitching them on either tomorrow, day after for the Monday call and then you can just give us some more Flavon. That. That would be really helpful.
Me: So I will tell you two three things I know about Kaushik. So I know Kaushik. Oddly enough, Steve, I started this because of Koshit. What I do now.
Them: All right.
Me: So, because in September, I just left Clarissa. I was thinking, what do I do? I went to his office. He said, come talk to me. He said, look, I have lots of portfolio companies within and outside. They all struggle with comms. They're all really smart guys, but cannot communicate to save their lives, often can't. Talk about their business. He said, I'll give you a couple of portfolio companies. But there's a huge demand for this. Very few people do it in the US they're very expensive. So he said you should start.
Them: Yeah.
Me: He immediately gave me a couple of his portfolio companies. One worked out. I still do work for them. The other one is, like, in the air, and now I'm talking to a third one. In fact, I spoke to them next week. So he's been. So I speak to him, like, once a week. He gives me tips and tricks and talk to these guys and so on. So what I know about Kaushik, I'll tell you. The guy does a lot of work with fintech companies he's obsessively focused on. Because he's X Stripe. No. So he has a lot of info into. Payments companies. So the companies I know is directly dealing with his stacks AI, which is building AI End of month closing software.
Them: Okay? Yeah. Yeah.
Me: Pay Rails, which is a full payment, full stack payment thing for you to pay for anybody to anybody globally. Largely B2B product paid AI which is building AI monetization to agentic building and monetization tools. If you're a SaaS company, you deploy agents. How do you build for their work? So he does a lot of work in deploying AI, using AI for payments, using AI to figure out how much work your agents have done. All of that stuff. Super non bullshit. Very, very sharp. And I know he's aggressively following deals. Now, I don't know how many of them are pre AI or post AI. The ones I talk to are all using AI in some form. But I also know the other portfolio companies is invested in is in beside.
Them: Okay?
Me: There's a company called Beside. There's a company called Marvel X. And he's also putting in money into a robotics company and a few other stuff. He does a lot of stuff for them because I think he's now driving ventures out of London. But he's very keen on payments and fintech. If I get any more. If anything else comes up in my meeting notes, I'll tell them to.
Them: Okay? Please. And I'd love to run you through how we're approaching the pitch because, again, this ties in directly to how you're thinking about Kims.
Me: Yeah. Cool. So let me. So what I did was for me, the two main questions were. One, you said one Siddhu said which is. Sidhu was like, look, what do we have to do? For an IT services guy to acquire us in 12 to 24 months. Okay, and the other thing, which is you said is, look, we are doing 30k deals. We are doing 1 million deals. How do we make sense of both of these things? This was on my mind. So what I did over the last couple of days was Monday and Tuesday was I was looking at completely what is happening in the IT services space right now. In terms of data, productivity, all of that stuff. Okay, you might know all of this, Steve, but I'm going to repeat everything to you because I think.
Them: Oh, no, it's fine.
Me: A couple of very interesting things is that.
Them: By the way, do you have fathom.
Me: I use Granola?
Them: Is it recording?
Me: Yeah.
Them: Will you send me the recording? Then.
Me: Send it to you. So it'll send you the transcript. I'll give you notes as well. So what I did was I said, okay, what is the state of especially Indian IT Services? From what I realized from the Huron call, it's not just an Indian thing, but so very interesting thing, Steve, is that largely for the last 10 years, One big trend is that revenue per employee has been flat. For all of them. It only pumps up when they let a bunch of people go, but they almost always end up hiring a bunch of people again. So revenue per employees generally stuck at a particular number. And largely for every million dollars of revenue, these guys need to hire 20 to 25, 25 to 30 employees for every million dollars of revenue. It has been flat, regardless of tech, regardless of whatever, this number has been flat. And they've slowly started bringing up in analyst calls that we need to improve our revenue per employee. Thing is they don't know how to do it. They are saying we'll use AI now what are the using AI for? They are like, we'll give everybody cursor. We'll give everybody. Debt. That is not going to. I don't think that's going to actually improve revenue per employee at all.
Them: So that's a point that I also figured, which is to say that it's not a tooling or a procurement problem. It's a workflow problem. And the other bit. I think you said this to me or I read this Sameer else. Is that your math on when you're saying that for every million dollars of net new revenue that they had, they got to add 20 to 30 people? And when they don't do that. The what ends up happening. Is that the reason why they have these prolonged projects? Is because they have a very big bench. So they can absorb the cost of this project. Internally. Right. So their margins always look flat or look marginally improving. If they cut a bunch of people this month or next, this quarter or whatnot, margin goes up slightly, there's some more ROI on their stock price. And that's rinse, repeat. That's how they keep working this.
Me: Exactly correct. So this is one important trend. So this is one on my thought, right? ROI and employees flat. They've tried all kinds of things. They're throwing Devon. It will not help. ROI is flat. More interestingly, what is happening again, I'm looking at analyst calls, I'm looking at numbers and so on. These guys thrived off the fact that they had a large number of 90% plus were multiple year, million dollar, multimillion dollar projects that were renewed very rarely. So they built entire sales presales, development, design, whatever orgs to serve customers like this. Which is we will sign a 30 million, 100 million, whatever million dollar deal and we don't need to worry about it for five years, 10 years, whatever. All of these guys were built. This is completely changing the average deal. Sizes are coming down. Two things are happening. One is average deal size is coming down. Second, a lot of these customers are now saying that I want to renew every year. These guys are not designed for annual renewals. They have. Their sales teams can't function. Annual renewables, their internal documentation, procurement process, doing the paperwork, security assessment. None of it is designed for fast turnover. Renewals. It's just not designed. And it's becoming a huge problem. And they've also admitted it. I think Mahindra or one of these other guys said that 25% of our deals are now up for frequent renewals and that number is going to be. So what's now happened? Is, like I said, this is kind of like this barbell shaped thing where they still have a lot of legacy deals that are old. But they know that all of these deals will no longer give you five year renewals. They're all going to change into annual or two year renewal deals. That important to keep in mind. Second thing. And I was talking to a guy, a friend of mine, well, school father. He is a sales engineer with Snowflake. So he was saying one of the problems they're having is they've signed these multimillion dollar deals with Morgan Stanley. He comes to Bangalore, he goes to Chennai. He does like he's that guy. He's Morgan Stanley snowflake. He said, the problem now is Morgan Stanley is coming to them and saying, you've got AI now. No. Do this 150k project for us. Do this 300k project for? He said boss, we are not designed to do 150k 300k project on profit. It will lose money for us because we are all. Our entire org is designed to sign and deliver on 3 million dollar deals 30 million dollar deals.
Them: Is that. Is that baked into the way that they bake their teams and the leverage ratio that they're currently operating in?
Me: It's not. They have to actually do it as a. They do it on vibes right now, is what he said. He said, this is not baked into the contracts we have right now.
Them: No, what I'm saying is that why can't they service 150 KD?
Me: Because his point is it needs requirements gathering. It needs to be configured. Somebody has to do the testing, and then you have to deploy it and then give it to them, he said. All of our steps are very expensive to do this.
Them: Okay?
Me: Because, again, I didn't go into super detail. But his point was that we are designed as an org to look at multimillion dollar deals. So suddenly I can't wake up a team of 7 people to evaluate her for 150k 300k deal customers are expecting AI do it quickly Also customers expectation is that look, if you do this 300k d from me or 3 million dollar deal will come afterwards Sameer else in Morgan.
Them: Okay? Yeah.
Me: Stan, so I can't afford to say no also.
Them: Yeah.
Me: What's happening? Is that like I said? What? Therefore, in my thinking, what does an IT services company have to look like, say, five years from now? Just a number. Two years, three years, whatever. One. The barbell is going to even out completely. You're going to have deals from three, let's say $30,000 to $3,300 million. You're going to have deals of all sizes. Customers are going to expect you to deliver all of these.
Them: Y.
Me: You have to be profitable at every price point. Making your engineers move faster is not going to help because your sales team is not going to be able to move fast enough on a 300k deal or 30 KD because you're going to move at the 30 million dollar deal. So therefore. The new metric I'm thinking of, Steve, is that it's no longer going to be revenue per employee has to increase. Like, I don't think Infosys is going to survive if it keeps his RPE at this level, it has to double.
Them: Eah.
Me: Huron's rp will reduce.
Them: Why? Why?
Me: Again. My thinking is that because their deal size are also going to get reduced.
Them: Okay?
Me: Because.
Them: All right. Okay. Okay. Got Whatay.
Me: You see, my in fact, my thinking is these two businesses are going to converge. The consulting and the IT implementation business are going to converge. They're going to hit a particular level of RPE at some point in between because companies are going to tell them, look, implementation is easy for you. Why am I paying you a premium.
Them: Yeah.
Me: These guys are going to say, look, whatever, right? So my thinking is RP again. Very early thought, Steve. But RP has to increase number one. RP has to increase number two. Whether it is 30k or 300k, you need to be able to run the deal from top to bottom profitably. Irrespective of the size that a deal comes to you with. Okay? Just to park it in your head. My thinking is, therefore your metric is no longer any of the geometric is friction per unit of revenue. I have to minimize my friction per order of revenue. Unit of revenue.
Them: Okay, I like that. Okay?
Me: For every $1 of revenue my company makes my friction by cost of selling, cost of compliance, cost of pre sales delivery. Everything has to come down to a minimum. You no longer can look at per engineer productivity. You have to look at the entire pipeline. Therefore you need a company if you are going to build AI into your company. It is not enough to give cursor or devin to an engineer. You need to have an AI system that goes end to end across the company. You need an XO that can sit from top of the funnel, through the middle, through the bottom, all the way to the end. Your security guys have to use AI Your legal guys have to use. You have to build it that way. None of these guys can build it this way because that is not how the teams are. Organized.
Them: Yeah. Right.
Me: So your problem is actually a good problem because you're saying I can do a 30k deal profitably. I can do a 3 million deal profitably because XO is making me profitable for every unit of revenue.
Them: Hell.
Me: Am I making sense to you?
Them: Yeah, you are.
Me: Right. So my thinking is the IT services company of the future cannot say I will only be profitable at a certain price point. I have to minimize friction per order of revenue across my entire org for every contract. It cannot happen at human scale. Your engineers will move faster. Your sales guys are like, boss. Okay, I don't have time. Your delivery case. My God, I'm stuck here. Everybody needs to move at that level of speed, and the only way to do that is to actually have an entire AI backbone that is built for the IT services industry. So when you go to somebody and say, I'm profitable at 30k and a 3 millionk. You are saying that I've solved for the friction per unit of revenue.
Them: Stop. If I'm to extrapolate that thought process. Right. And I know this early, early days. How would you quantify fiction? Per employee. Or per what fiction? Per.
Me: Order of revenue per unit of revenue.
Them: Unit of revenue for an existing business. Like how. How would you put a number to it? Like, say, Infosys is at one. I'm at 0.5. Like, how to. How to think about that.
Me: I think the only way to think about, and I don't know, this might be a thing that already exists. Is that you need to start thinking of total cost of delivery. Like the way you calculate margins of. Margins of projects need to change.
Them: Okay?
Me: Because right now Infosys is like, we'll spend a million dollars on presales and sales. Why? $30 million revenue. We will optimize for delivery cost.
Them: Yeah.
Me: You can't do that anymore. Because customers are not going to accept that anymore. They're not going to accept the fact that these are the margins you're using. AI. Why are you not more profitable? Why do I ought to always come to so my thinking is a total cost of delivering a unit of revenue has to come down. Again. I haven't like, there has to be a metric you need to come up with, but for me, friction is. The reason I can't tell you it's total cost is because it's a combination of time and money.
Them: Dude, what you're saying is 100% on point, right? And I think a lot of it is. Maybe it's just listeners bias. But when you say that it has to be embedded across the entire workflow, Most people start its pre sales and they end at delivery, right? You're talking about, dude? Every bit. Including legal.
Me: Yes.
Them: Including getting your not just your sows through that same pipeline. But also your contract review, your sow review, all of those things which would technically be a bottleneck, need to go through this, like, sausage making machine effectively. And so that you have the turnaround time, that you get back to the customer.
Me: Correct.
Them: Is now no longer a friction point.
Me: That is so for me, total cost of friction. The reason I can't tell you a dollar. It's a company. It's actually a velocity of money thing. If you think of economics, it's a combination of money and time. Your legal card. Guy can't take three months anymore. Yesterday, three days.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Your security guy cannot take three days. Your compliance guy cannot take two months. All of this has to become faster. And you cannot make it faster by only making you by giving Devin to your engineers. Or clawed to your sales guys. You now have to have a system. Where? If I talk to you and you tell me when can you start? You ask. XOXO says you can start next week because the architect is on leave.
Them: Yeah.
Me: That is the only way it will work.
Them: I don't know whether you have access to this or you have. You. You. You've sort of got this through the grapevine. But. You talking about? Specific bottlenecks that traditionally exist, like compliance and security. For bottom
