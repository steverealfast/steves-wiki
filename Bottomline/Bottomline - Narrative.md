# **Bottomline — AI Customer Service Narrative**

*Audience: Yaderl Padilla, Robert, Angela + customer service leadership.*

## **The Landscape**

Customer service across the Thoma Bravo portfolio is moving. This isn't speculation — it's what the sibling companies are reporting:

- **SolarWinds** has deployed a multi-phase AI stack across their service desk: virtual agents, GenAI-powered draft responses and ticket summaries for agents, and as of October 2025, an autonomous AI Agent that diagnoses outages and suggests remediation. Their 2026 roadmap includes auto-generating knowledge base articles from solved tickets.
- **Proofpoint** restructured their knowledge management with AI-powered search and deployed an internal AI assistant. Results: **40% productivity increase**, **18,300+ hours saved annually**, and a session-to-ticket ratio that moved from 3:1 to 40:1.
- **Kaseya** embedded AI directly into their service workflow — auto-triage, auto-categorization, copilot-assisted resolution, and auto-generated SOPs from ticket data. Results: **40% reduction in triage time**, **13,000+ SOPs generated automatically**, engineers saving hours per week.
- **ConnectWise** launched AI-native ticket triage, root cause analysis, and automated reply generation inside their PSA platform. Results: **40% faster resolution**, **86% improvement in first-time fix rate**, **75% time saved per ticket** on routine work.
- **RealPage** deployed an AI front door that handles **95% of incoming questions** without human intervention. Only 5% transfer to live agents. Adopters report **10 hours saved per employee per week**.

These are the wins being reported back to Thoma Bravo's executive team. That's the context behind the Emergency AI Council — and it's the standard Bottomline is now being measured against.

## **Opening**

You've been asked a direct question by the executive team: *where's your plan?* We're here to help you build one that's structured, measurable, and reportable.

The portfolio companies claiming wins above didn't get there by buying AI tools. SolarWinds built a three-phase journey over years. Proofpoint restructured their knowledge architecture. Kaseya embedded AI into the workflow itself. What they all have in common: they changed how work flows through their service operation — not just what tools sit on top of it.

That's the approach we take. We don't start with technology. We start with process — understanding what your agents actually do, step by step, interaction by interaction. Then we classify where AI can generate real value versus where it would add complexity. Then we prove it on one workflow before expanding.

We're already inside your operation. ExoHelp is in pilot with your BAs. Service Assistant is in scope. We're not starting from zero — we're building on a foundation that already exists.

## **The Framework**

Before applying AI to any customer service workflow, we classify the type of friction:

| | AUTOMATE | AUGMENT | CONNECT |
|---|---|---|---|
| **The problem** | Agents doing unnecessary manual work | Agents making decisions without adequate support | Systems and data that don't talk to each other |
| **Symptoms** | High handle time, repetitive tasks, manual ticket routing | Inconsistent responses, slow escalation, missed patterns | Toggling between systems, no customer 360, manual lookups |
| **AI mechanism** | Auto-categorization, self-service resolution, wrap-up automation | Real-time recommendations, draft generation, next-best-action | Knowledge retrieval, cross-system data stitching, unified views |
| **Business lever** | Cost-to-serve reduction, throughput | CSAT, first-call resolution, revenue per interaction | Operational efficiency, reduced handle time |

This is the same classification the portfolio companies used to structure their deployments:

| Category | Portfolio Examples | What We Deliver |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **AUTOMATE** | Kaseya (Smart Ticket Triage), ConnectWise (Sidekick), RealPage (LUMINA) | **Service Assistant** — AI-powered ticket classification, routing, and self-service resolution. Already in scope for Bottomline. |
| **AUGMENT** | SolarWinds (GenAI agent assist), Kaseya (Cooper Copilot), Proofpoint (Amazon Q) | **ExoHelp** — Already in pilot. Impact analysis, evidence documentation, test case generation. Extends into full agent augmentation. |
| **CONNECT** | Proofpoint (NICE CXone Expert), SolarWinds (AI KB generation), Barracuda (Assistant) | **Exocortex** — Captures institutional knowledge from every ticket and resolution. Builds a queryable knowledge layer that compounds over time. |

The question is which category represents the biggest opportunity for Bottomline today. That's what the process investigation answers.

## **The Ask**

We're proposing a structured engagement in two phases:

**Phase 1: Process Investigation (2-3 weeks)**

Over-the-shoulder observation with your service agents. Process mapping of actual workflows. Classification of every major workflow against the framework above. The output: a scored list of the top 3-5 workflows where AI would move the metrics your executive team cares about — AHT, FCR, CSAT, cost-to-serve, agent utilization — with projected impact and ROI for each.

This is not a strategy engagement. There is no 50-page report. The output is a decision-ready plan: which workflows, which AI interventions, what the projected numbers look like, and what to do first.

**Phase 2: Proof Point (3-4 weeks)**

Select one workflow from Phase 1 — the one with the best math. Build and deploy an AI system against it. Measure before/after impact against baseline. You get a production system embedded in a real workflow, used by real agents, with measured results you can report.

We're not asking you to commit to a transformation program. We're asking for one investigation and one proof point. If the numbers work, we talk about what's next. If they don't, you've invested weeks, not months.

---

## **If This Works**

In the first six weeks, you complete the process investigation and deploy AI on one workflow. You have a measurable delta — handle time, resolution rate, cost-to-serve — against your baseline.

At that point, you have something none of your sibling companies had when they started: a structured framework that maps every customer service workflow to the right AI intervention, with proven results on one. The expansion path is clear: apply the same model to the next 3-5 workflows, each deployment compounding on the knowledge captured by the last.

Every workflow we instrument captures institutional knowledge — about your customers, your processes, your edge cases. This becomes a knowledge layer that makes every subsequent deployment faster and more accurate. That's the compounding advantage: the first deployment is the hardest, and every one after gets easier.

*For TB's executive team: "We've deployed AI on [workflow]. [Metric] improved by [X%]. We have a structured pipeline of additional workflows with projected impact. Here's the expansion plan."*

## **What This Looks Like as a Timeline**

| Phase | Duration | What You Get |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Process Investigation** | 2-3 weeks | Scored workflow map, friction classification, projected impact, ROI model, implementation plan |
| **Proof Point** | 3-4 weeks | Production AI system in one workflow, measured before/after impact, stakeholder documentation |
| **Expansion** | Ongoing | Same playbook applied to next 3-5 workflows, compounding knowledge advantage |

**Total time to first measured proof point: 5-7 weeks.**

---

## **Closing**

The portfolio is moving. The executive team is asking questions. The answer isn't a tool purchase or a strategy deck — it's a structured process investigation followed by a measured proof point.

We're already inside your operation. ExoHelp is generating value in the BA workflow. Service Assistant is in scope. The next step is understanding where the biggest opportunities sit across your full service operation — and proving it on one.

Let's build the plan.

## **Reference Talking Points**

**The portfolio benchmark:** Six Thoma Bravo portfolio companies have deployed AI in customer service with measurable results — 40% triage reductions, 95% auto-resolution rates, 18,300 hours saved annually, $70K/month operational gains. That's the standard. The question is where Bottomline sits relative to it and how fast you can close the gap.

**Process before technology:** Every portfolio company that claimed wins changed how work flows through their service operation — not just what tools sit on top of it. SolarWinds built a three-phase journey. Proofpoint restructured knowledge management. Kaseya embedded AI into the PSA workflow. The common thread: process investigation first, technology deployment second.

**We're already embedded:** ExoHelp is in pilot with your BA team. Service Assistant is in scope. We understand your Salesforce environment, your ticket workflows, your team dynamics. This isn't a cold start — it's an acceleration of work already underway.

**The five metrics that matter:** AHT, FCR, CSAT, cost-to-serve, agent utilization. These are the metrics every service organization measures and every PE firm tracks. The process investigation establishes your baseline and identifies which workflows move which metrics. Everything ties back to numbers.

**Compounding knowledge advantage:** Every workflow we instrument captures domain knowledge into Exocortex. The first deployment is the hardest. By the third or fourth, we're operating at a fundamentally different speed — because the system has learned your customers, your processes, and your edge cases. This is how Proofpoint went from a KB migration to 18,300 hours saved annually.

**How to frame it for the executive team:** "We've engaged a partner already embedded in our operation to run a structured process investigation — the same approach our sibling portfolio companies used to achieve their AI wins. First measured results in 5-7 weeks. Here's the plan."
