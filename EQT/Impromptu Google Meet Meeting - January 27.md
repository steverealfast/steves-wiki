# **Impromptu Google Meet Meeting \- January 27**

[**VIEW RECORDING \- 54 mins (No highlights)**](https://fathom.video/share/SX6z8-sKa1ynRYqSwJewUqbFwm7AG-SR)

[@0:04](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=4.74) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

Thank you. Thank I'm back.

[@0:54](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=54.8) \- **Vinay Mimani**

Yes. So, like a quick down. Load on NUS, the breadth of problems that you're seeing there, and then I'll get into a little bit of specifics.

Sure.

[@1:07](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=67.96) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

Uh, so there's also like a three slide deck that I created when we were talking to PKXV about what AI transformation for us looks like, right?

[@1:22](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=82.28) \- **Vinay Mimani**

Yeah.

[@1:22](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=82.62) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

So I can also walk you through that because I think that sets a little bit of context and then I will discuss NUS in that context.

[@1:31](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=91.14) \- **Vinay Mimani**

Yeah.

[@1:32](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=92.68) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

So I'll just open this up. So, yeah, this is our same triangle, right? And I just reframed some of the words to kind of make sense of what you're seeing right now.

Yeah. So, there are three offerings in the AI transformation AI services stack. One one is… How to… So clients to think about AI, right?

Which is embedding AI into client processes, identifying activities where ROI is highest, identifying their biggest pain points and solutioning around that.

This is platform agnostic.

[@2:14](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=134.32) \- **Vinay Mimani**

This is workflow agnostic.

[@2:15](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=135.98) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

This is typically just, you know, there are a bunch of clients, this is to increase top of funnel, where there are a bunch of clients who say, Hey, we have an AI mandate, we have, you know, a budget, but we don't know where to start.

Or even if they know that they want to start in this department or this workflow, but yeah, specific understanding of how to get it done, etc.

[@2:35](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=155.92) \- **Vinay Mimani**

is not there.

[@2:36](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=156.74) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

That's where we come in. That's where we will talk to them, guide them, etc. And we will carve out projects from here, right?

So while we're not going and doing a whole hog AI transformation anywhere, the way we are running it, and that's more of an implementation methodology thing, which is we will find a small thing, fix it for you quickly.

Us being a small company gives us the opportunity to deliver by the time somebody else gives you a proposal.

[@2:59](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=179.58) \- **Vinay Mimani**

you 0,497 Us

[@3:00](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=180.0) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

And once you have established credibility on a small piece of work, we are starting to find land and expand is working very well over here, right?

[@3:10](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=190.32) \- **Vinay Mimani**

So that is bucket one.

[@3:12](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=192.7) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

From bucket one, think lands bucket two and bucket two type of work, which is as we discover more and more workflows and as we understand more and more use cases for the client, we start noticing that there are some commonalities in terms of which platforms they're using, what integrations they're using, what workflows like, for example, the SDR workflow has zoom info and Apollo, whatever at one end, it has an email integration on the other end documentation, a documentation usually has a docu signer at the end, or maybe an OCR at the start, right?

So there are a bunch of integr, custom integrations, bunch of enterprise systems that you're using, we're currently not calling it out, but we'll discover, for example, how Oracle DB works, or how some Delphi code works.

So we'll start looking. at platforms in that lens. Salesforce is an already established platform for us. So if you're using Salesforce, we can deliver work for you even quicker.

That's kind of like the platform delivery pitch. And then there'll be horizontal workflows that we can extract out from there, which are not necessarily platform dependent, but they are very use case dependent.

And then as I build that into my platform, I can almost start giving people XO, right? Which is the long term.

How do I start delivering software licenses on XO to people? So in that, the interesting thing that I have found is the one that is the highest, at least attention seeker from a client perspective is our SDLC process, right?

It is our ability to deliver on a day-to-day basis that kind of builds the credibility that they should come and work with us.

And so most of the clients are very interested in how we do it. And if we can. How do it?

Is there something that we can teach them to do it? Right. And especially in FinTech, etc. We saw that the market size for their developer, that how much they paid development teams is in the billions of dollars, just Singapore market banks, right?

We have over a billion dollars to their development teams. There's a lot of room for us to go and engage with them over there.

Our document processing, you and I have discussed a lot about that. is a very clear horizontal because it's a prevalent problem across most verticals.

And especially in banks and wherever we're seeing BFSI, that frequency of document processing is much higher. Legacy diagnostics is something we're seeing with boardroom.

And if we can prove that we basically have a proof point that even if your code is 10 years, 10, 12 years, there's a rewrite happening.

If your code base is really old, our agents can go figure out, document it and start either platform modernization or new feature addition on the same code base.

can be done very easily. that's the story you want to tell, boardroom is building that point of view, right?

[@6:07](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=367.46) \- **Vinay Mimani**

And then finally, there's reporting and dashboards.

[@6:09](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=369.64) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

I see reporting and dashboards as very similar to document processing, except the output is not a document, it's a dashboard.

And I think, I don't think it is any different from what people talking to task about six or eight months ago, right?

It's basically here, you have stuff on your Salesforce, we'll dashboard it out, dynamic dashboards, daily dashboards, different dashboards for different teams.

All of that is easily possible. Now, in that stack, we've currently looked at custom dashboards, which we've done, like you can do at any point of time with Claude, right?

[@6:48](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=408.22) \- **Vinay Mimani**

We've noticed by Tableau, but all indicators from JJ and Polymy say that Tableau should be something that we should be able to say, that we'll be able to do dynamic dashboards on.

då . . . next

[@7:00](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=420.0) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

But we, like, again, when we have a use case where we've done it for a client is when we can claim it, but we should definitely focus some energy on figuring out given Salesforce synergies, if we can do dashboarding on Tableau.

And the third one, which is something we're doing with NUS right now, which might open up a lot of doors is Power BI.

So we've figured out how Power BI MCT works with Cloud Code, and we've figured out how Power BI works with SharePoint.

So if your customer has a Microsoft Office license, then they will have Excel, they will have Word, they will have SharePoint, and they will potentially have Power BI.

If they have these four licenses, we should be able to do a bunch of recording and dashboards for them in an automated fashion.

And I see that as very similar to document processing, but there's a visual element to it. Yeah, yeah, got it.

[@7:50](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=470.6) \- **Vinay Mimani**

So this is kind of how I'm thinking about it.

[@7:52](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=472.96) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

In this, we're saying that there are three pillars that we stand on, which is speed and quality is no longer a trade-off.

[@7:58](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=478.2) \- **Vinay Mimani**

We are accountable for outcomes.

[@8:00](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=480.001) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

And not for just the implementation, and we have enterprise-grade security and compliance, which makes us very appealing for enterprises that usually would move slowly, but want to move fast.

[@8:10](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=490.581) \- **Vinay Mimani**

Yeah. Yeah. Uh, makes sense.

[@8:14](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=494.641) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

This is like, so overall, now I want to deep dive into both the clients and what we're observing over there, right?

Uh, on NUS, the land and expand was straightforward. Uh, we had Sian, who is the head of NUS enterprise, who's a friendly, he wanted us to come in and talk about AI transformation.

We gave a simple pitch that gave us a small problem. We will solve it for you and, uh, it will build momentum, uh, the end game for him.

And this has evolved over the last, I think now it's been four months, but, uh, the end game for him was, Hey, can I build a pilot or build an initial project?

That's so good that it will convince NUS, the U. University as a whole, that AI is the way forward to go.

And so he's a bought-in stakeholder. The way I would characterize his personalize, he knows AI is the next big thing.

He wants to convince everyone in the organization that AI needs to be used, but he did not have enough firepower to do that without an implementation from us.

So he wanted us to do the POC to make that point and then use the POC to go and get budgets and approval to do more stuff.

The interesting thing that changed first time over there is he didn't actually need the POC. Based on all the discovery that we did, just a demo video of what this could potentially look like was enough.

And he showed the video to them and he got the buy-in and they gave him mandate that go ahead and think about whatever you want to do.

Who was this?

[@9:50](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=590.16) \- **Vinay Mimani**

Sorry, sorry. Go ahead.

[@9:52](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=592.36) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

Who was this? This is Sian. And he presented the board of directors.

[@9:56](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=596.68) \- **Vinay Mimani**

The board of directors. Okay, okay, okay,

[@10:00](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=600.501) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

So he went there and the computer science department head basically was like, dude, I will be your sponsor for any pilots you want to do.

So not much buying he got on the basis of one video. He came back very happy after the video and he said, yeah, POC, do.

But honestly, that's such a low hanging fruit and it's so small. I actually care about much bigger things. Then he took us on this path where he wants us to do this research funding platform and this IP commercialization sort of mandate.

I'll come to that, but that requires IT approvals and he's had some fallout with IT. So it might not go forward, may go forward, may go forward in a different scope.

We will see all of that. But in the meantime, we started delivering on contract generation POC. We finished the POC.

The last week of the POC was where two light bulbs like flicked on, right? Number one, the daily delivery we could do and this just comes down to our FDE capacity and how we bootcamp them, how do you train them?

But just being able to give them a daily cadence where morning you give requirement and feedback, evening we give you a finished product, became addictive.

It was literally like they couldn't wait for the next day. And so much so that they are now like, yeah, we have faith, you will deliver, don't worry about it.

You just send us the proposal, locate it, right? Nice. So that is the level of buying that daily delivery got.

And I would not, I cannot stress enough importance on how much we should be focusing on our delivery methodologies to enable that to happen.

Yeah. Numbers, the second light bulb that got switched on was as soon as Steve, now Steve is the third guy in the picture.

So let's talk about organizational hierarchy, So there's Cian Tan, he's the head of NUS Enterprise. Steve Tan reports to Cian.

Steve Tan is your administration head. Uh, but the interesting thing about him is he's ex-meta. So he comes from a place where internal tools and internal, uh, processes have always been very.

Good. And now he's in a fairly high bureaucracy sort of environment, which he's trying to bypass. And he's like, how can I get internal tools and workflows to work better?

So he's aligned with Siyan on the fact that AI needs to be delivered, but he was not very confident on where it could be delivered.

Contract generation was a piece that him and Siyan sat together and carved out for us. Now, the minute he saw the contract generation POC in action, he was like, bro, I can do things.

[@12:31](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=751.401) \- **Vinay Mimani**

Right.

[@12:32](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=752.221) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

And he introduced us to his internal, uh, IT support team. He said, yeah, Inco, they get, you know, uh, requests ad hoc on WhatsApp all the time.

Uh, is there any way to collate all of this, bring it to Slack or bring it to an internal Jira board so that we can track it.

And at this point of time, Sido basically opened up our Slack and showed manager and showed how we do our team up tracking and stuff like that.

And he was like, dude, man. Then he was like, Hey, we have some payment processes, it's a super painful.

I want to do API integration on that. But, uh, IT is telling me API is too expensive. They are suggesting that I do RPA, but RPA is so 2005, what can I do now?

Uh, and Sidhu kind of excited him with a web browser agent. And he's like, now he wants to apply a web browser agent to every place where his team is filling a form.

And we're like, okay, hold on, maybe web browser agent is not the best thing in every case, we will look at it case by case.

Right. and then the third thing he did was he introduced us to his finance controller and said, she spends one to two days every month trying to reconcile our budgets and forecasts and create dashboards.

And this entire process is super manual, super painful. Today takes very long time. Can you help us automate it?

And that's the next project we are landing from a POC perspective, which is, and it's not there on this list over here.

Uh, which is their finance reporting, uh, which is. Every month, they get one revenue number from SAP with different line items across different BUs and every month they get one HR cost basis from SAP, which is manual, sorry, manpower spend and other budget spend, etc, etc.

And she wants to create a P\&L from this on a monthly level, create a balance sheet on a monthly level, track it against forecast, track it against budget, see how it's doing, build a bunch of dashboard.

This piece is what we're helping her, like crunch the time to less than an hour. Today they take one to two days, right?

[@14:38](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=878.222) \- **Vinay Mimani**

One piece of news, got it, got it.

[@14:40](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=880.662) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

So that is the second project. I'll come to the remaining two things that are there on this page. But basically, they are now like, hey, we know what sort of work we can give you.

We know we can give you small pieces of work, you build the main process for us, and then that will give us confidence to actually build it out in production.

And so the playbook that we are going to follow over here is about 10K USD Manilo ticket size for a POC for four weeks.

And then once that is done, another two to three month implementation at the full cost. Hopefully each one of this POC plus full cost should get us 100K overall, right?

Each stream is how we're positioning it. So it'll be 10K plus 90K sort of range, right? And we're seeing that it's worked once for contract generation, it's likely to work again for finance, and then we'll see how the rest of them play out.

If they have enough confidence after these two, we might just go into a retainer model with them, right? Saying you just keep throwing workflows at us and we keep doing it.

And I know then Isaac, I owe dedicated capacity, very managed services type. But I think they are also slightly not comfortable with that model right now.

And they are also skeptical of how much work they'll be able to find for us. So fair on both accounts.

Let's talk about the other two because I think they're really cool use cases, but I think they require high buy-in from the customer, which we don't have right now to kick it off.

But they're very interesting problems. So enterprise- an US itself. At an US itself, the research funding and IT commercialization, right?

These are what I would call as part of the AI transformation bucket. They're not like modular platform workflows. They're something new, and they're very interesting.

So enterprise, a new enterprise has three pillars. One is their incubation center, which is how do I invest in startups?

The second is their student center, which is a new student's exposure into startups. And number three is their patent center, which is, hey, out of all the research that is coming out of the university, what patents can I now sell to startups or sell to companies even?

Thank And how can I build a SDR workflow on top of that, right? So IP commercialization is literally SDR agent, but for IP.

And the way they want to do it is they want to bring all their patents together. And today they were saying some 3 to 5% of their patients are commercialized.

So that's very low. So they're like, yeah, we spent billions of dollars on research, but we get millions in return.

So how can we increase? And this is going to be a revenue stream for NUS enterprise. And they are fully bought in on making more money out of it, right?

Because now it's being headed by two very enterprising folks for lack of a better word.

[@17:42](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=1062.62) \- **Vinay Mimani**

Got it.

[@17:43](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=1063.5) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

But there are two guys who worked in growth companies. And so want to grow versus they're not bureaucracy who's looking at, okay, patent is coming, like budget of patent is a social good activity.

It's something I need to monetize the lens. So So they are really focused on doing IP commercialization, which is SDR agent, but they realized that today the problems are very different because they don't have a patent database.

They don't know what sort of data they want to engage with. They don't know who would be the right customers to engage with.

Uh, and so before we even get there, they were like, Hey, that can be the full scope of things, but can we do one very simple pilot where with the computer science department, computer science department, let's say, has a million dollars of budget to give for research.

Uh, but usually the ask is 10x that. So if they have 100k, 1 million approval request will come in.

If they have 1 million, and so basically he just gave me a number, I'm making these two numbers up, but it's a 1 is to 10k ratio of how much budget they have available to how much budget requests they get from process.

So they have to kind of prioritize whom they're going to give research funding. Today, is done on the basis of who knows who and done on the basis of what people subjectively find promising.

They are asking us if we can, and we found some very interesting things in this space, if we can kind of build in some sort of early signal of commercialization potential into the research itself, right?

So if a professor proposes that this is what I'm going to do research on, the more details they fill in, we help them do some sort of research on the addressable market for their research in the future.

So it's obviously going to be highly subjective, but instead of making a call on gut instinct and on like who knows who, you make a call, the panel gets a bunch of additional information now, which is, is the addressable market very high?

Is there immediate commercialization potential? Is this going to take some time? Is this a nascent market? Is it a niche market?

Is it niche It around, how can you think about prioritizing your budget?

[@20:04](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=1204.28) \- **Vinay Mimani**

They were like, dude, this will be already enough to kickstart people's enthusiasm.

[@20:09](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=1209.1) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

But once this happens, then there's enough data about what patents are there. And in the meantime, they'll build a database of patents and then we can build the SDR agent.

So IP commercialization comes after that almost phase two, but phase one is what IP should I invest my funding budget on?

[@20:27](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=1227.68) \- **Vinay Mimani**

Right.

[@20:28](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=1228.34) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

And this is why I'm saying it's like a very new use case because potentially you were not able to do this earlier.

Like getting academics to write a business case is almost a no-go, right? Uh, now you're saying, Hey, you focus on your academic part.

I will try to do a very rough high level estimate of business case and come back. Uh, so that is interesting.

This is what he wanted the mandate for, by the way, this is what he wanted to do large scale.

But now he's like, it is basically pushed back saying name, don't touch us with the AI. So this call never happened for RealFast, it's happened between NUS Enterprise and NUS IT, a bunch of back and forth, RealFast never got involved, and this week Sian came back and told us that, listen, I am not working with IT anymore, you tell me what you want to do.

So there's a bunch of work we can continue doing on enterprise side, but obviously the big ticket for us is to get into the university.

So we have to kind of propose strategies of how he should now use the buy-in that he has from board of directors and from computer science department to start building pilot projects that enterprise will deliver, not IT, right?

[@21:38](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=1298.32) \- **Vinay Mimani**

What is enterprise's main KPI? What is enterprise's main KPI?

[@21:42](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=1302.46) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

Yeah, they have three things. They want, they have a $100 million fund, which they want to convert into a $1 billion AUM.

So they have to 10x their returns on incubation. They have to create a hundred startups that are doing something for the world with impact, which is highly subjective, but

Okay, 100 startups is an objective number. And then they have 1 billion lives touched or something as a third KPI, which is basically that they should be investing in companies that have large-scale impact.

But it's incubation arm of NUS, right? And there's a bunch of very interesting things, right? There's matchmaking between students of NUS and startups of NUS.

For jobs, for good talent hiring, for matchmaking on co-founders. So he's got all of these ideas in his head, but he's like, yeah, let's do it one at a time.

And we are very happy to do that. Of course, of course. So there are a bunch of things he's thinking about from an incubation center perspective.

He's thinking of running it as a business. So it's very similar to if you were to go to an enterprise client.

So they're sitting with 300, 400 million dollars of budget inside a university that moves very slowly usually. So everything we do is like, wow, this is like too good.

That is also context for why we are getting so much praise from there, because they are not used to that pace of delivery.

Like, so for example, they, at the same time, he is an ardent Salesforce hater, okay? So he is like, NUS University uses Salesforce, I will not touch that product, like IT will get in my face.

I don't want Salesforce, so he went and got monday.com, and he's implemented monday.com, and dude, that implementation has been a total disaster.

Like, they promised them something in six months, and it's been close to a year, they've not gone live. So he's also generally pained by pace of delivery, even of startups.

So, Rialfast kind of brings in that flavor that, yeah, will do we will But yeah, I will pause here, because this is the full story of enterprise.

And any questions or any thoughts that you wanted to fill in here?

[@23:55](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=1435.0) \- **Vinay Mimani**

No, I'm just, I'm just absorbing. There's a lot of context. The key personas that we were talking to, just to summarize, Enterprise Head and Head of Admin under Enterprise, these are the two.

[@24:10](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=1450.86) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

but the guy has a background in tech, so that also plays a role. Like, he basically is a very, we're not testing it out yet, but is a potential power user of EXO.

He kind of gets, gets the hang of AI can really supercharge my workflows. So he's not a traditional admin persona.

He's a tech guy who has been put into admin to revolutionize the process. Got it.

[@24:40](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=1480.8) \- **Vinay Mimani**

And these, the use cases around finance, this is all the finance team within Enterprise, correct? Yes. Yes. And we have to kind of find a bridge to, you have to find a bridge between?

[@24:54](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=1494.44) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

find a bridge to the university, which we don't have yet. We're just in Enterprise time.

[@24:58](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=1498.3) \- **Vinay Mimani**

have right now. Got it. So within enterprise, if I had to think of enterprise as a proper company itself, right, within NUS, which are the business functions that you have kind of got traction at in finance, finance procurement, in a way, basically, Sian is the CEO of this company, which has this kind of budget, and you've got him convinced, and he's looking at everything within that company, you've got traction in finance and procurement within that.

And the way he talks is, it's crazy, right?

[@25:30](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=1530.82) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

He'll just be like, dude, these guys, they take three days to make a report. Who takes three days to make a report in 2026?

Like, it should just be as simple as, yes, I look at the numbers, I click a button, and it's done.

Right? Like, yeah, that his region. And that's where he's coming from. So yeah, good for us.

[@25:49](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=1549.12) \- **Vinay Mimani**

Good for us. Okay. And so this is super clear, I think. And NUS, I think I'm clear now, and problems, think you anyway told me, right, contract generation, procurement.

Finance reconciliation, Dashboards, Analytics, all of that, right? This is clear. No, this is super clear.

[@26:08](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=1568.36) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

Power BI in our arsenal, then bro, I think we can go target a very wide set of people. Because Power BI is one of the most painful things that people find to set up.

Isaac is going to be our in-house master of Power BI. He will the entire cloud code in the sentence and configure the dashboard.

Once he gets the hang of that, then I think we can build playbooks and playbooks of how to integrate any Excel to Power BI.

[@26:32](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=1592.74) \- **Vinay Mimani**

Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. Got it. No, this is really helpful. So anyways, I think, is there anything else that you think we should know from a persona, pinpoint, value, perspective?

I think, uh, I'm focusing on more on enterprise right now. I understand the IP wall up angle. But anyways, that is in university, right?

That's core university. Correct. IT will come in, everyone come But anyway, actually, see, the interesting thing is, one of my junior is a professor at Northeastern University.

So he was talking to me last week. was like, yeah, I seminar. So I asked him, what is the problem of So he's like, yeah.

So then I ran him through the same set of problems. He's like, yeah. So he works within an AI lab at Northeastern.

So he's trying to connect me to his head, who runs the AI lab within the same set of problems.

Yeah. And I think, see, the problems will be same.

[@27:38](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=1658.46) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

What we need in the persona is someone who understands some level of tech to just be pained with the current process, right?

You need to be that tech savvy that you're like, bro, this is very old. This process is very old.

And then also be a little bit of a, and this is where Sian helps us, but I'm setting the marker very high.

Sian a visionary. Sian is of some sort in terms of how their university is going to be the best in the world, right?

Yeah. Like that is the dream they really need to be bought in on, yeah, I will use AI to like transform my university.

I don't know how is fine, but the conviction that yes, we need to do something to move away from this current process, this is old, this is stale, has to come from that persona.

If it's not there, we will have to invoke that, but it is just much easier if it's already there, right?

That's what I want.

[@28:29](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=1709.16) \- **Vinay Mimani**

Of of course, of course, got it. Oh, yeah, no, I think NUS is pretty clear, man.

[@28:37](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=1717.52) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

Boardroom, we don't know that much, but I'll just give you a very broad understanding of the situation, right? Yes.

The context is, boardroom is this CARTA type product that does ESOP management for employees of companies. They are primarily...

How do we know them?

[@28:57](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=1737.22) \- **Vinay Mimani**

What's our friendly? What's Sian was our angel. What is friendly here? Shobit. Yes.

[@29:03](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=1743.74) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

So Shobit has been connected there through the PE company that owns boardroom. So that's an interesting angle for us because we've also always had this thesis that PE has some sort of velocity play.

[@29:14](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=1754.58) \- **Vinay Mimani**

Yeah.

[@29:15](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=1755.14) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

And this is something we're getting to validate over here. Plus there is a upward top of the funnel if we do well here, right?

Because we didn't go to the PE and say to us other portfolios where you need this. So the PE is friendly with Ajay.

Ajay put Shobit at boardroom. And so Shobit is tasked with revamping this entire company's tech. And he's bringing in a bunch of vendors out of which RealFast is one of them.

So he's brought in Shuru, he's brought in Test Vagrant, RealFast will be the third one he'll bring in. And then he's bringing in Abhinandan's team for mobile as well.

Got it.

[@29:56](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=1796.96) \- **Vinay Mimani**

Got it. Got it. This is very similar 2014 C4.

[@30:05](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=1805.26) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

But I think this time we are operating at a higher level because we know everyone in the ecosystem. So all that means is the ACVs for everyone is higher.

And so the acquisition price, if the acquisition happens also, it would be higher.

[@30:22](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=1822.96) \- **Vinay Mimani**

Yeah, but the ceiling is kind of raised throughout.

[@30:26](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=1826.42) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

The context here is, uh, boardroom bought a piece of software, uh, from Morgan Stanley, uh, a couple, about exactly a year ago, right now, uh, about 13 months ago.

And when they purchased that the agreement they had with Morgan Stanley was they do not own the software. They only own the customer base and the contracts, and they get to use the software for two years in which period of time they get to build the capabilities and the features into.

their own product. And then after two years, they stopped getting licensed to use the product in this because Morgan Stanley wanted to exit the region and boardroom primarily operates in Southeast Asia, Australia, New Zealand, with some presence in rest of Asia.

And Morgan Stanley wanted to operate in rest of Asia, Europe, North America, South America, but not in Southeast Asia and Australia.

So they basically got all the projects contracts, right? Yeah. Now it's been 13 months. They had created a list of 77 high priority features to have parity on, uh, by end of December, 2025\.

So that in one year, they'd be able to transition out of the product, the contract for the product ends in December, 20, 26\.

Oh, okay. That's why I thought January, 20, 26, out of those 77, they have implemented 24\. 24\. Hmm.

[@31:58](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=1918.74) \- **Vinay Mimani**

And they have a bunch.

[@32:00](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=1920.0) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

of high priority ones, which they have not even touched. And more so the urgency is created by the fact that one of the biggest customers of their product is a customer that comes through this contract, which is BHP.

BHP is a mining metals sort of company. BHP has said that unless you have this particular feature that we have got the project for, which is the New York Stock Exchange integration.

So currently their product is connected to Australian Stock Exchange and Singapore Stock Exchange. They're not connected to the New York Stock Exchange.

But unless you get New York Stock Exchange on Boardroom's original product, they will be forced to look at another vendor because BHP is dual listed.

And so they want to give ESOPs on both exchanges. Not ESOPs. Actually, in this case, it's shares because they're publicly listed.

Right? So it is almost critical for them. And I'm assuming the value is in millions, if not a billion dollars.

Hmm. Uh, of revenue loss, if they do not get these features live and Boulder, sorry, BHP wants these features live by, by April.

Hmm. And these guys have basically spent 13 months doing 24 features. There's no way they're going to do this by April.

Their internal estimates were saying that they will take up to September to do this, by which point they would have lost the customer.

So here now, let me walk you through the organization. It's a little bit of a mixed bag. The CEO of the company is one of the PE operating partners.

Okay. She has pulled by in to do things quickly and to ensure that the customer is not churned. Correct.

Because it's her responsibility to flip the company's value once they have purchased it. And this is going to be a, a big, big point of that because this is their largest customer ever.

Right. Uh, once they have both BHP, they basically are like, yeah, that is the logo that we will be.

We were to take to our other customers and say, BHP has signed, so please you also sign. Correct.

[@34:05](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=2045.06) \- **Vinay Mimani**

In the same case, how are you looking at?

[@34:07](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=2047.12) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

Exactly. I'm like, I'm all the way, right? We are like, our boardroom is the guy who should have a boardroom, so they are in that situation where there is a CEO who has absolute full buy-in, not in Showbit, through the PE only, to help revamp speed and time and et cetera, et cetera.

Showbit is also one of the stakeholders who's crucial from a selection of speed, time, quality sort of thing. Yeah.

The rest of the org, there are few people who've come in by the acquisition of the product of Morgan Stanley.

Right? Those people are fairly high capability, high skill, sorry, high willpower, doing good work and want to transition the features.

They understand the feature set of the Morgan Stanley product. They're trying to map it onto the boardroom product. And then there's the existing boardroom team, most of whom have already got a sense since the PE acquisition.

And now even more so since all these vendors are coming in, that their jobs are at risk, because there's a PE company now on the top of us.

And so anything can happen. So there's a lot of, I would say resistance from that aspect of the art.

But a lot of momentum from the other aspect of the art. So on one side, we've signed the SOW over the weekend.

And like, we've got the go-ahead to get started. And the CTO today sent in the InfoSec document saying, until you finish the InfoSec, we will not be able to give you access.

Right? And the CEO is like, guys, we signed the SOW yesterday. They should have got access today. Skip the process.

Oh, wow. Right? Like, we just need to get started because we're losing. The client is the biggest problem right now, but the process has come in, like Mittal got a mail separately saying, no, you must do this without anyone else marked.

So I told Mittal, reply back, marking the CEO again, right? These dynamics exist. Couple of very interesting characters over there is the solution architect also is really good.

He's one of the guys whom I felt did not have too much exposure to how good AI implementation works.

And he saw a few examples from us and he was just floored and he was like, bro, you tell me what you want done.

I will do it for you. Right. So we got buy-in pretty quickly from the architect. We already have buy-in from Shobit.

We already have, sorry.

[@36:44](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=2204.21) \- **Vinay Mimani**

What, what was the demo we showed him? Yeah.

[@36:46](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=2206.81) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

We were showing him how we use AI just internally. Like Sidhu ran him through his red, green, yellow checklist for testing, like very basic architect level stuff.

Right. And he was just like, dude, I need to incorporate this into my workflows. So that was with him, Shobit obviously has buy-in, CEO obviously only cares about speed and time and cost.

So that buy-in exists. The other stakeholders we'll have to see, we just kicked off today. So we'll have to see the context.

Again, I gave you the context of the entire thing, but the other context over here is this code was first started to be written in 1983\.

And most of the code is similar. There is only one person in the organization who understands the full code.

And the last rewrite they wanted to do on .NET started in 2014 and has been ongoing for 12 years.

They use Delphi and .NET on Oracle database. And this is basically the platform stack. They haven't modernized in a decade.

So they have missed, as Shobit puts it, they have missed all the technology revolution since the internet. effect. Sound

Uh, and they are basically just, uh, on their same old code stack doing the same thing. It works very reliable product, very compliant product, but they follow waterfall development model and it takes them a long time to do anything internally, which is why if they had to get this, uh, customer to be retained, and that is the pain point here, right?

Very clear agenda. The only thing we ever talk about is how are we going to demo to BHP? Hmm, right.

[@38:31](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=2311.51) \- **Vinay Mimani**

They have scoped out everything.

[@38:32](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=2312.95) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

They've given us all the requirements, detailed Excel sheets, all tech specs, whatever documentation they have, whatever walkthrough they have, they've not given us code access yet.

Once we have that, then we'll have our own documentation, but they've given us everything saying that only focus on pace of development of work.

[@38:51](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=2331.13) \- **Vinay Mimani**

Right.

[@38:52](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=2332.07) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

Uh, and, and so this is an interesting use case. If we deliver it successfully, then we can actually go and say that, listen, it doesn't matter.

If you're using legacy systems, if you want to do new feature development or platform modernization, I'll come and do it and I can do inhuman things over here because honestly, there's not too much talent that can come and do Delphi coding anymore and that's going to be a big problem for them wherever they look and nobody's going to promise them the timelines we are promising.

So it is a little bit of a risky project for us because we have to meet a few very aggressive timelines.

Siddhu and Prashant seem comfortable as long as we get code access on time and as long as their QA process does not delay us.

That is probably where I would say the delta of conviction between the client themselves and us is very tripped in our favor.

Like the client thinks they're getting into a good deal because they're putting everything on a payment milestone basis and they have no incentive to delay us.

And we think we're getting a very good deal because we should be able to meet the timelines. And so we'll get paid our bonuses and if we get paid our bonuses, we are very good.

And if we meet the timeline. And they have no problem in paying our bonuses because that's peanuts compared to what they would otherwise lose.

Correct. So it's a very interesting situation where they feel that someone it less nine months. So if RealFast has taken this up to do this in five months, they are going to lose out.

But in the off chance that RealFast actually does it, we are great.

[@40:25](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=2425.65) \- **Vinay Mimani**

Very high upside if you are able to do it. Yes.

[@40:30](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=2430.49) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

And so the contract is also kind of structured that way, where our base rate also increases. Once we've proved the UAT to them, our bonuses also start kicking in on timely delivery of three milestones, and then we have a decently high kicker.

If we, they find us so valuable that they have to renew our contract. We have a retention bonus. And, and the reason why we did it as a retention and not as like a end of year-level platform.

So. So. Thank Comments bonus is because we know that the scope of the project is five out of 77 features.

So let's assume they have done 24\. Let's assume they managed to over the next six months, do another 12\.

That's 36 plus we will do four, five. So we're at 41\. They still have 36 features that are in their backlog just for this project.

So we know that there's going to be enough work over here coming through the system. Uh, in the truest sense, and just to be completely honest on this internally, uh, this is not AI transformation.

This is IT silver services delivered through AI. Yeah. Right. But the, it allows us to also build their conviction in us using AI and hence their conviction in us advising them about AI.

Okay. Because as soon as this project Atlas is done, like we project. seven, seven, seven, Atlas is what they're calling the feature replication of the Morgan Stanley product.

But as soon as those 77 features are done, that's when this company needs to think about, okay, now where do we fit in AI into our processes?

And if we are their thought partners on AI delivery, then hopefully we should be able to then start talking about, okay, let us tell you where you should put AI in your product or in your processes.

Dude, I'll bring all the, uh, NUS, uh, things that we would have learned on document generation and stuff and come back to them and say, Kya tumare company mein AI hai?

Uh, toothpaste mein amak hai is always a very, uh, catchy line for him. Uh, but yeah, I'm thinking that is where we kind of expand here from an AI transformation perspective.

But right now, this is just pure play legacy IT services delivery, but through AI, so we can do in human timelines.

If we can prove this, then this is a very interesting offering. Right? Because it does not need you to want to do AI.

Yeah, it wants you to be okay with using AI to do other stuff that you want to do quickly.

**ACTION ITEM: Share meeting recording w/ Vinay \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=2587.9999)**

[@43:10](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=2590.03) \- **Vinay Mimani**

Yeah, it's a different take. Yeah, no, no, this makes sense. Say it. Got it. This was really helpful. I'll have to go back and observe, share the recording with me if it's private.

It should be open.

[@43:27](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=2607.13) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

but yeah, I'll share it.

[@43:28](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=2608.13) \- **Vinay Mimani**

But yeah, this is any other slides you have on this?

[@43:31](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=2611.31) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

No, basically, the reason why we had done the entire meeting was to discuss, sorry, it's not moving, but to discuss personas, which is what you were discussing.

But for her, because it's a VC, we kind of kept it very high level saying enterprise CXOs, PE operating partners and portfolio companies of yours, which are at enough scale to be wanting to think about AI transformation.

What, what, this was just, yeah? This was just, yes. And on the third one, she herself said, no, most people will not be at that scale.

But we told her basically, okay, forget about portcodes. And that is what I wanted to do with her also, right?

Forget about portcodes because I don't think the portcodes, when we did the Salesforce scan only, figured that was not necessarily the right target, right?

I was like, I don't think the portcodes are what I want to look at. What I would rather look at is anybody in your network and friendlies who are PE operating partners.

And so she was like, have you all gone back to EQT? Because her friend is at EQT, I think.

Yeah. So Steve was like, okay, cool. We'll go back to EQT with the broader offering outside of Salesforce. Similarly, enterprise CXOs in her network, who might be thinking about business outcomes, not AI pilots, kind of gave her that.

She asked for a blurb. We sent her the blurb before sending it out. She's now come back saying, do you also have a deck, but we will take them.

We don't have a deck. So we'll figure out the deck.

[@44:53](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=2693.63) \- **Vinay Mimani**

Got it. Makes sense, man. That's all the slides I have.

[@44:57](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=2697.77) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

Sorry, I thought we'll do slides and then we'll go.

[@45:00](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=2700.01) \- **Vinay Mimani**

To your framework, this was a, yeah, no, this captured it, man. This gives me some thought process in terms of how to now kind of turn this towards lookalike customers.

Yeah.

[@45:14](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=2714.85) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

And so I would say lookalike is on three axis, right? One is obviously verticals. So finance, fintech plus education.

Correct. The second is in terms of the persona. So what we've spoken about is this is find fairly been top down, right?

On both sides, we have CEO buying. Yeah. So, so there's a certain type of CEO persona who's excited to this.

that could be a lookalike that I would look at. And the third lookalike is basically in terms of platforms or workflows.

So legacy system code, uh, document generation is fairly universally applicable, uh, and, uh, SDLC is universally applicable. just Thank

For most tech-enabled companies anyway. So I would not, I don't think there is even a need to narrow the ICP on the vertical or the horizontal side.

It is more about finding, friendly might not be the best, largest time, but finding people who will resonate with this narrative.

So the, yeah, no, you're right.

[@46:27](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=2787.99) \- **Vinay Mimani**

The thing is, if I go and talk to a NUS competitor or someone who aspires to be NUS, I can still go and talk to everyone about these use cases as long as that persona and business function exist.

First, there would be dropping NUS now because then that's an immediate, so similarly, boardroom competitors, right? was looking at it.

So I have a list of- Boardroom is third market share in Southeast Asia.

[@46:55](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=2815.29) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

So there are two guys who are bigger than boardroom. Yeah.

[@46:58](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=2818.53) \- **Vinay Mimani**

So we will go and talk to the- What are the two big guys? Is it, uh, I have the list somewhere.

Let me, do you know the names?

[@47:09](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=2829.61) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

I don't, I, I, they themselves told me that we are the third market share in this. So that's how I know they're third, but I don't know who's one.

I got Vistra.

[@47:18](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=2838.83) \- **Vinay Mimani**

I got Incop Global, TMF Group, Oxford, so kuch kuch hai, uh, but yeah, so yeah, exactly that, right? Basically, basically competitor ko bola, thumare competition kisim tam karer hai, to validation immediate ho jayega, but otherwise we can go and which, uh, wherever that persona and workflow it is.

[@47:37](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=2857.99) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

no, so I would, I would take the boardroom thing to make a cut on saying power bi, Delphi, code, uh, waterfall, uh, SDLC.

Those are the, the, the, market on that, uh, I won't. Mark it on that, but I will identify on that and market boardroom.

[@48:04](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=2884.07) \- **Vinay Mimani**

You will, aren't, so, so say that again, didn't get it.

[@48:07](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=2887.65) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

What I'm saying is that, you know, the pain point is not that it's a FinTech product that is, you know, uh, needing a new feature, right?

The main point is it's legacy code, they follow waterfall system and they can't do new feature development anymore.

[@48:22](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=2902.51) \- **Vinay Mimani**

Yes, yes, absolutely. Uh, that will be the one line statement that we send to them, right? which resonates with them because that is the constraint of any of the companies in that.

Correct.

[@48:33](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=2913.47) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

And so then that's why I'm saying if, if that broadens my funnel, I'm okay with that, like, but I anchor at this point and then it brings a lot of eligible companies in and then some people will find boardroom exciting.

Some people will find the fact that we worked with Delphi exciting. Some people will find the fact that we worked with power bi exciting.

Yeah.

[@48:52](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=2932.53) \- **Vinay Mimani**

Yeah. Uh, that time is pretty big. It's just that, uh, when you go in and talk to their competitors, your chance.-phwards of conversion are a little higher.

It's just that.

[@49:00](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=2940.81) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

Yeah, yeah, agreed. But yeah, it's just a prioritization.

[@49:03](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=2943.63) \- **Vinay Mimani**

It doesn't reduce the time.

[@49:05](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=2945.35) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

It's just what we target. The reason why I'm saying that is given where we are, I'm not sure if prioritization gives as much value at this point of time than just spreading that message and then seeing who walks through the door.

Because at the end of the day, we have cracked two deals and both of those deals have been serendipitous for one reason or the other.

And so I have no reason to believe that the third deal will be similar to deal one or deal two, but more reason to believe that deal three will be as serendipitous as deal one and deal two.

[@49:41](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=2981.37) \- **Vinay Mimani**

Dude, but I can't target based on that.

[@49:43](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=2983.99) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

No, that's what I'm saying. What we target is based on the pain point. And then we see who resonates and walks through.

Versus if we target specific individuals that already means we are talking to five people instead of 500\.

[@50:02](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=3002.15) \- **Vinay Mimani**

In, in which, in this case today, and also in action items, it will boil down to the same thing.

I mean, when you, when you target 500, how will you target it? Like put it into action. How will you go about it?

How will you prepare?

[@50:17](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=3017.63) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

Fair point. I don't know. have to think about this right now. What you're saying is absolutely true.

[@50:22](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=3022.59) \- **Vinay Mimani**

You're talking about the entire account book. I'm just saying, I have account book. I have 500 companies. From where do I start?

That's the question, right? It's just that, but we are on the same page in terms of the account book.

[@50:37](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=3037.81) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

Yeah. Like I would, like, again, I don't think we do enough of this, but literally what I spoke to you today is probably a talk.

**ACTION ITEM: Draft GTM plan (lookalikes, messaging, events); then schedule dinners w/ Boardroom CEO \+ Sian \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=3042.9999)**

We go in given 500, like conferences. We should.

[@50:51](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=3051.51) \- **Vinay Mimani**

That's why I get, I don't know how to action that.

[@50:53](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=3053.69) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

And like, I will work with you on the GTM front on this, but we need to be going. I like, I think...

don't I'm going. No. Now I can go and speak. I have enough context that I should go and do like a half an hour thing.

You have worked on two deals.

[@51:07](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=3067.03) \- **Vinay Mimani**

And that is one of the goals for me, right? I want to do that private dinner thing. Now we have these stories, right?

Which is what I wanted to kind of get out of you. So we'll do that. We'll do.

[@51:18](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=3078.07) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

because I feel like, dude, like, let's say there are a hundred people in the room and I speak dispassionately for like half an hour.

Four of them will come after that call and say, yeah. Absolutely. Right. And there is no other way I feel that this is like, Steve was asking me, dude, how would we scale this GTM?

I said, dude, it's relationship building. Like I see this as McKinsey does sales. We have to go and we have to be top of mind too of risky CEOs.

[@51:41](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=3101.33) \- **Vinay Mimani**

It's just that, which is why that closed door event has done. This boardroom CEO sits out of where?

[@51:49](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=3109.77) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

Singapore.

[@51:50](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=3110.95) \- **Vinay Mimani**

Perfect, man. You talk to her, not now. Let me come back to you with the plan. We will plan it around so that if she is coming as a CEO.

Right. So there is a crowd puller.

[@52:02](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=3122.01) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

Yes. No, so I've given this job to Steve. Steve is supposed to meet her and glad handle her once a month.

Perfect.

[@52:09](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=3129.09) \- **Vinay Mimani**

So then if she's the crowd puller, then there can be one winner, which is only in the cohort of companies like that, who will be interested in listening to the CEO of GoTo.

[@52:18](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=3138.35) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

Yes.

[@52:19](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=3139.01) \- **Vinay Mimani**

Similarly, the other plan is to get Siyan. Siyan and then Gojek. Hanska is more like a very big crowd puller, but it's...

I mean, because it's Finns also, so it will work, but I wanted to do, now that boardroom is here, earlier I was thinking of Siyan, but I want to do Hans and this boardroom CEO together.

That's like...

[@52:42](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=3162.59) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

No, we should do Siyan also. Dude, Siyan is a charismatic personality, bro. He will also be one of those people who will say half an hour ke liye speech deena hai, but woh 40 minute, 50 minute ke liye bolte jayega.

[@52:55](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=3175.13) \- **Vinay Mimani**

So weise 2 plan kar sakte hai. I want to kind of also do more than one, right? Then a...

These different audiences, so that's why this recording is super helpful for me, because now I can understand what you're saying and then use this also as a way to outreach and then think about that.

Cool. Let us, let us think again later. Anyways, plan for But this was super helpful.

[@53:24](https://fathom.video/calls/546900386?timestamp=3204.53) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

I'm glad to help. Super. Take care. Bye. You too. Bye.
