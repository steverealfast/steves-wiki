# EQT Portfolio - AI Transformation Opportunity Scoring

## Scoring Methodology

We evaluate companies on four dimensions that indicate readiness for AI transformation:

| Dimension | What We Measure | Why It Matters |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Operational Complexity** | Employee count, geographic spread, size of Ops/Finance/Support functions | More complexity = more manual workflows = bigger automation opportunity |
| **AI Maturity (Inverse)** | Presence of AI/ML teams, AI tools in tech stack, AI-related job postings | Companies with no internal AI capability need external partners to transform |
| **Hiring Signals** | Active job postings in Finance, Ops, IT, Customer Support | Active hiring indicates budget availability and willingness to invest in capacity |
| **Process Intensity** | Finance/Ops headcount, multi-system environments, manual workflow indicators | High process intensity = high ROI from automation |

### Score Scale

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **5** | Very high opportunity / Very low AI maturity |
| **4** | High opportunity / Low AI maturity |
| **3** | Moderate |
| **2** | Limited opportunity or data gap |
| **1** | Low fit |

**Max Score: 20** (sum of 4 dimensions)

## Company Scores

| Company | Operational Complexity | AI Maturity (Inverse) | Hiring Signals | Process Intensity | **Total** |
|---------|------------------------|----------------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **VFS Global** | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | **19** |
| **IVC Evidensia** | 5 | 4 | 5 | 4 | **18** |
| **Nord Anglia** | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | **16** |
| **WS Audiology** | 4 | 3 | 5 | 4 | **16** |
| **Magnit Global** | 4 | 4 | 2 | 4 | **14** |

## Detailed Scoring Rationale

### VFS Global — Score: 19/20

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Operational Complexity | **5** | 6,800 employees, 3,900 visa centres across 165 countries; Operations function alone has 2,784 people |
| AI Maturity (Inverse) | **5** | No AI/ML tools in tech stack; "Generative AI" appears in job posts signalling interest but no capability yet |
| Hiring Signals | **4** | 110+ active job posts; Operations (48), Customer Support (32), Finance (20) actively hiring |
| Process Intensity | **5** | Operations-dominated org (41% of workforce); highly manual visa processing workflows with strict SLAs |

**What this means:** VFS Global has extremely high operational complexity with virtually no AI maturity. They process 100K+ visa applications daily with manual document verification, data entry, and customer queries. SAP-centric back-office with no AI tooling. Strong candidate for document processing, workflow automation, and customer service AI.

### IVC Evidensia — Score: 18/20

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Operational Complexity | **5** | 3,200 employees across 2,500 veterinary clinics in 20 countries; Finance (305) and Operations (292) are large |
| AI Maturity (Inverse) | **4** | Minimal AI/ML stack (Databricks, Windsurf, Pandas only); nascent and data-engineering focused, not deployed ML |
| Hiring Signals | **5** | 638 active job posts; Finance (219), IT (149), Operations (145) — most active hiring among the 5 companies |
| Process Intensity | **4** | Finance function growing; multi-ERP environment (Oracle, NetSuite, AFAS, Odoo) indicates complexity |

**What this means:** Highly fragmented veterinary clinic network with aggressive hiring in Finance and Ops. Multi-system finance environment signals integration and automation opportunity. AI is nascent — only used for data engineering, not clinical or operational AI. Strong candidate for finance automation, clinic operations, and back-office consolidation.

### Nord Anglia Education — Score: 16/20

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Operational Complexity | **4** | 6,000 employees, 89 schools in 37 countries; Finance (174) is the largest corporate function |
| AI Maturity (Inverse) | **4** | Only Databricks and Alteryx in AI/ML stack; educational org, not tech-forward |
| Hiring Signals | **4** | 220+ job posts; Finance (154) dominates hiring, cyclical pattern aligned with school calendars |
| Process Intensity | **4** | Multi-ERP (SAP, Dynamics, Sage) — M&A-driven complexity; OneStream for consolidation |

**What this means:** Finance is the priority function with the most active hiring. Multi-ERP environment from school acquisitions creates consolidation and automation opportunity. iSAMS (school management system) is core operational platform — any AI partner must integrate with it. Strong candidate for finance transformation and multi-entity consolidation.

### WS Audiology — Score: 16/20

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Operational Complexity | **4** | 5,900 employees, 73 countries; Customer Support (318) and Finance (289) are largest functions |
| AI Maturity (Inverse) | **3** | Has R&D AI/ML stack (MATLAB, TensorFlow, Databricks) for hearing science — but enterprise AI is absent |
| Hiring Signals | **5** | 809 active job posts; Customer Support (389), Finance (230), IT (169) — very high volume |
| Process Intensity | **4** | Digital Procurement Transformation underway (Zycus, SAP Ariba, Coupa); Finance growing fast |

**What this means:** Highest hiring volume across all functions. Active Procurement Digital Transformation in Singapore signals transformation appetite. R&D has AI/ML capability (for signal processing in hearing aids) but enterprise operations (Finance, Customer Support, Procurement) lack AI tooling. The R&D AI does not transfer to business operations — still a strong candidate for operational AI.

### Magnit Global — Score: 14/20

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Operational Complexity | **4** | 3,800 employees across 45 countries; Operations (743) is the dominant function |
| AI Maturity (Inverse) | **4** | No tech stack data available; no AI signals detected |
| Hiring Signals | **2** | Zero job posts tracked (staffing company posts jobs for clients, not itself — data limitation) |
| Process Intensity | **4** | Operations-heavy (743 people); manages contingent workforce across 160 countries |

**What this means:** Operational complexity is high but hiring signal data is limited. As a B2B staffing platform, their job posts appear under client brands, creating a data gap. The lower score reflects reduced visibility rather than lower opportunity. Requires direct engagement to assess transformation readiness.
