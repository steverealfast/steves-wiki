# Gamma Deck Prompt — realfast x EQT

*Paste this into Gamma as your deck prompt. 10 slides. No fluff.*

## Prompt for Gamma:

Create a 10-slide presentation deck. Style: dark, modern, minimal. No stock photos. Use clean data visualizations where noted. Tone: sharp, direct, confident — written for senior PE professionals who have zero patience for filler. Every slide should land one point. No bullet-point walls. Short sentences. Let whitespace do the work.

### Slide 1: Title

**realfast x EQT**

AI-native IT services. Proven at $30K and $1M. We only charge if we deliver.

---

### Slide 2: The Industry Is Broken

BVP Emerging Cloud Index: down 30% in 12 months. Indian IT services stocks shed $12B in market cap in a single day. SaaS multiples compressed from 25-40x to 15-18x.

Revenue per employee across IT services has been flat for a decade. TCS doubled revenue from $16B to $30B. Headcount also doubled. The ratio did not change.

The industry's response: buy point solutions. An AI tool for FP&A. Another for month-end closing. Another for developer productivity. Each solves one node. Each creates a new data silo. None of them answer the question: is this actually the bottleneck?

---

### Slide 3: The Metric That Matters

**Friction per unit of revenue**: the total cost — time and money — to move one dollar from first conversation to delivered outcome.

For IT services firms, this number has never moved. It never had to. Contracts were large, multi-year, and back-loaded. A major US consulting firm told us it takes their team two to three years to come up to speed before real value reaches the customer.

For portfolio companies, the metric flips: **friction per unit of savings**. If you optimize G&A with a traditional SI, it takes 5x the time, many more people, and your office swarming with consultants. The cost of achieving the savings approaches the savings themselves.

---

### Slide 4: What realfast Has Built

realfast is not a systems integrator that adopted AI when it became fashionable. Built from day zero by domain experts with vertical and horizontal expertise, overlaid with state-of-the-art AI models.

We dogfood everything. Our company runs on the same infrastructure we deploy for others.

Three ways companies deploy AI: in the product, for building the product, and to run the company. The industry is fixated on the first two. We built the third.

---

### Slide 5: Diagnose First. Then Activate.

This is the core differentiator.

**Diagnostic layer**: Ingest a company's data, processes, and operational context. Identify where friction actually exists — not where it is assumed to exist.

**Activation layer**: Deploy that diagnosis into working solutions that move a business metric within weeks.

Point solutions can only activate. They optimize one function regardless of whether it is the real bottleneck. You optimize month-end closing and discover the real constraint was upstream data quality. You accelerate FP&A and find the friction was in how leadership consumed the output.

Exocortex tells you where the actual constraint is, then removes it.

---

### Slide 6: The Proof

Same operating model. Same infrastructure. Same economics.

| | Deal size | Margin | Delivery |
|---|---|---|---|
| Small engagement | $30K | 70% | Weeks |
| Large engagement | $1M | 70% | Weeks |

If the model only works at one price point, it is an optimization. Working across the full range is a structural shift.

Every project makes the next one faster. Domain knowledge compounds in the system — it does not walk out the door when the team disbands. A competitor starting today is behind on every engagement we have already run.

---

### Slide 7: Your Portfolio

EQT has adopted AI at the fund level. Motherbrain. A 40-person digital team. The mandate is real.

273 portfolio companies. Adoption rate: a fraction of the fund. EQT's own data shows only 20% of investment professionals generate the bulk of AI usage — and that is at EQT itself.

The further from the centre of gravity, the lower it drops. This is not a technology gap. It is an execution gap.

---

### Slide 8: We Have Done the Homework

Of the 273 companies, we have identified a shortlist where the operational profile — G&A headcount, legacy technology, growth stage — aligns with immediate, measurable impact.

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Vinay to insert portfolio company table here. Company | Function | Quick Win. 5-10 companies. -->

These are companies already on a growth trajectory where operational complexity is starting to outpace the team. Not laggards — companies where speed matters.

---

### Slide 9: The Ask

One engagement. One portfolio company. One business metric.

- Function with visible friction: G&A, RevOps, or support
- 4-6 week delivery window
- Fixed scope, milestone-based
- If the metric does not move, we do not invoice

The proof format is a timeline. Day-by-day, from first conversation to delivered outcome to invoiced payment. Not a case study. A visible record of speed.

---

### Slide 10: What Success Looks Like

Success is not whether the project is delivered. It is whether the company can go back to working the way they did before.

First engagement: prove one vertical. Second: prove another domain. Then the context graph connects across the firm — workflow optimization becomes enterprise-wide operational intelligence.

The portfolio-wide expansion is not something we pitch today. It becomes obvious after the first engagement delivers.

**Realfast comes in, finds where your operations are actually slowing down, and fixes it. We have done it at $30K and $1M, in weeks, and we only charge if we deliver.**

*Design notes for Gamma: Dark background. Accent color: electric blue or white. Minimal text per slide — use the short bold statements as headlines, supporting text below in smaller font. Slide 6 should render as a clean table. Slide 8 needs a table placeholder. No decorative elements. Let the words carry the weight.*
