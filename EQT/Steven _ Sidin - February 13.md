[**VIEW RECORDING \- 37 mins (No highlights)**](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929)

[@0:00](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=0.0) \- **Steven Sule**

Narrative that we are thinking about in terms of how to position this call. It's not a fundraising call from our side at all, though I don't know why he's got Corset in the loop.

It's actually just a call to go and chase them for work to be done. So similar to what we want to do with Huron, give us a project, a workflow, something for us to prove how we work, and then we can land and expand.

So that's the idea that we got. But I shared that document with you, I'm not sure if you had a chance to read it.

So that's how I'm thinking about positioning it. I would just be grateful for any feedback or any insights that you have into how we should be thinking about this, specifically for this call.

[@0:45](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=45.64) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

Okay, I was thinking about this a little bit since our last call, Steve. So I'll kind of summarize some thoughts I have, it may or may not align with what you guys are doing, but I want to kind of just get it out of my head, yeah?

Makes sense? Okay. So, I- So, I Meaningful to them, right? Where they have enough money, they have enough customers.

There's a flywheel of growth, delivery, pitching, compliance, all of this happening end to end. So you want to go to them with companies who are in their portfolio are already on that hockey stick and are on the danger of falling off.

Does that make sense? They're growing rapidly. They have to keep that velocity going. How do you do that as the company grows and gets more complex?

So my thinking was also when you go to them and say, I can do X, Y, Z and I can do it for one or more of your portfolio companies, whether explicitly or not, you're doing either a platform or a product play.

Does that make sense?

[@2:40](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=160.24) \- **Steven Sule**

Say that again.

[@2:41](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=161.6) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

If you're going to EQT and saying, you've got a bunch of these companies, I can do something for one or more of them.

Yeah.

[@2:48](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=168.7) \- **Steven Sule**

So you're not, it's not an IT services play for each one.

[@2:51](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=171.32) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

You're saying I can do something repeatable for any of the companies in your portfolio. Does that make sense? Yes.

[@2:59](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=179.56) \- **Vinay Mimani (Realfast)**

I know. No, it's a thing.

[@3:00](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=180.78) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

So therefore, by implicitly you're saying EXO is a platform, I can implement it for any of the companies in your portfolio.

But you're not explicitly saying that you're going to give them EXO effectively, right?

[@3:10](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=190.98) \- **Steven Sule**

You're saying EXO is your alpha in the way you can find them in efficiency. Correct.

[@3:15](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=195.98) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

But essentially you're implementing EXO for one or more of their companies. Is that fair? I mean, eventually, yes.

[@3:23](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=203.58) \- **Steven Sule**

That would be the plan, right? Yeah, correct.

[@3:26](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=206.02) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

No, the thing is, it's just important because if you're saying no, it's not, I'm going to go in and do bespoke solutions for each one, then that's a different message.

Vinay, feel free to pipe in. Vinay, completely disagree. No, no, please.

[@3:41](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=221.52) \- **Vinay Mimani (Realfast)**

So the way, at least I'm looking, Stephen, Shridin, is we are latching on to certain business functions or workflows where the payback period and the ROI is crystal clear, right?

Because of that, we might actually do some bespoke solution across different industries. The way we will do that is using EXO internally.

Correct. That's correct. I think that's what you were also saying. That's correct. You would have sent some hesitation, at least from my side when you said a product.

So it's, it's not a product, at least in my mind. Yeah.

[@4:16](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=256.96) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

No, I'm just saying that, which is why I was not sure where do I call it platform or product again, it's just a messaging thing because let's say, for example, if you look at, I had made a list of companies who are in the, that stage, I can look at it.

I just did some basic research, but you're saying that, okay, if you give me these three companies, we are going to EXO-fy each of these companies.

That's what they are not getting EXO-fied.

[@4:41](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=281.26) \- **Vinay Mimani (Realfast)**

We use EXO to deliver payback and ROI faster than any other SI or GSI in the, in, in the ecosystem.

That's fine. Again, I'm just saying.

[@4:50](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=290.84) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

So my thinking was that exactly what you said Vinay, which is we can come into your portfolio. Sorry, Steve.

My, my point there is right.

[@4:59](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=299.48) \- **Steven Sule**

And this is. I think we struggle a little bit is that when we talk about EXO, it comes across like we are going to EXO-fy them.

And they are then expecting that they get some version of EXO being implemented into their system. Now, our game plan eventually is that you build enough of these workflows in a company and then the connecting layer becomes EXO in itself, right?

But that's a much longer conversation to have. And when we start with that, then they expect that EXO is the baseline implementation that you do and all of the workflows get automated on top of that.

That's not the way we want to go because you want to go workflow by workflow and then extract EXO from it in a way.

[@5:41](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=341.68) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

So do you guys have a sense of which workflows you can do now? Yes. Yeah.

[@5:48](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=348.4) \- **Vinay Mimani (Realfast)**

So which ones are you taking now? So if you think about it as a Venn diagram, I'll give you first high-level view and then I'll go to high-level viewers.

as as a what's the the Intersection of any workflow, which has a business metric attached, has data today, data exists for that workflow.

And it is repetitive. If you look at that Venn diagram, the sweet spot is intersection of all three. If you break it down into business function, there is back office, which is generally mapping to G\&A.

Within G\&A, also finance, compliance, all of that, right? Any documentation, reconciliation, that is one. The second is your sales activity, more like the REVOPS kind of thing, because we have experience in that.

that is another one. And that is more around sales. And the third, I think these are the two broad buckets.

So anything around G\&A, anything around sales, and of course, support. Those are the three buckets. We have expertise on all three of them.

[@6:50](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=410.08) \- **Steven Sule**

And so the way we would frame that is that like, each individual company would have some version of this in their system, having work.

on projects that have done one part of these for different customers. For example, with NUS, it's purely on the back office function and on the finance and procurement function.

With Boardroom, it's a legacy migration, which is slightly different, but again, it's an automated, not automatic, it's a rapid version of migrating that legacy system.

And then with some of the agentic stuff that we've done on Salesforce, though it doesn't have to be on Salesforce, is the SDR agents and the support functions.

So having done these buckets across various customers, we have an ability to be able to go in and quickly identify a particular business metric that can be moved in a POC and use that as a proof of work to be able to further ingrain.

Yeah, I was, in fact, that's also what I was thinking.

[@7:50](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=470.48) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

Only thing, only thing I was stepping back and thinking was, I don't know how you'll do this, but you want to be able to go to EQT and say, look, these are five of your portfolio companies.

We think, for example, that these 5 or 10 companies are immediately places where Realfast can come and accelerate these workflows for you.

Vinay, something you said is very important, which is you can't go into a company with no context to optimize.

You need some level of existing context, some level of existing maturity for Realfast to come and show step function or exponential returns.

So I think one is, okay, look, we can look at these. We just looked at 10 companies and said, okay, these 10 companies look like they will have high GNA.

Hi, RevOps. Hi, whatever Steve said, an element of legacy. I don't know how many will be in the boardroom stage, but yeah, we have some data on that.

[@8:40](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=520.581) \- **Vinay Mimani (Realfast)**

So then if you want, I can quickly share with you. So along with Steve's narrative, right? The way we were looking at how do we kind of create that impact in the discussion.

I'm just sharing my screen. Give me a second. So what I wanted to do actually is I want to go in and tell boardroom that, Hey, dude, we have analyzed your 275 portfolio companies, right?

And this is actual data. There are 60% plus companies in the portfolio who at least have five people in back office, procurement, finance and legal.

And by the way, I've excluded all of these IT services. By the way, you mean, equity, no, not boardroom.

Oh, sorry. equity, this is equity portfolio. I remove all IT services and professional services company from the portfolio. Out of that 60% have at least five people in procurement, finance and legal collectively, at least five.

40% of those companies use legacy tech. And only 18% of these companies have actually put out job postings using JNI as a skillset.

Right? So this is how I'm trying to set that stage. And then we have a list of portfolio companies across geography, which at least have high count in GNA.

That list we have. I can also do the similar list for sales and support. But currently I did it for DNA because I saw the highest percentage being there.

And generally in my opinion, so then sales and all take a long time to pay back, right? And there's a lot of subjectivity.

The sales leader might say, Hey, I don't want to go ahead with this and all that crap. So I prioritize DNA as a slice.

So that is, we have that list. I can share that with you. If you want to kind of go through that.

No, no, no. This is fine.

[@10:28](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=628.541) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

I mean, again, like I said, you guys will have a lot more internal. Because the thinking I was thinking, this is my limited experience with EQT and working with Kaushik.

Kaushik's thinking for me is Kaushik talks to you and says, Okay, what are you really good at? Okay, prove to me that you're really good at XYZ.

Great. I am now going to introduce you to somebody and he will send an email saying, This guy is really good at XYZ.

You should talk to these guys. So the way you want to think about it is at the end of your meeting, what is that email that Kaushik is going to send?

To the 15 companies in his portfolio. What is he going to say? Speak to Vinay and Steve at Realfast.

They can come in and immediately improve XYZ for you through ABC, right? The only reason I said is that if you come across, I know you don't want to come across this platform or product, but if coming across this platform or product, the intermediary gets you into those calls with these guys quickly, that is not a bad thing.

It's just my thing. Because what you don't want is Kaushik to have to send a bespoke message to 30 companies in his portfolio.

He's not going to do that. Yeah.

[@11:33](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=693.841) \- **Vinay Mimani (Realfast)**

So in case he says, look, you guys need to speak to Vinay and Steve.

[@11:36](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=696.681) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

They're building an agentic platform that does XYZ for companies. They have dog-fooded it on themselves, which I think is the most exciting thing.

You guys have dog-fooded all of this on yourself. We've done small deals, big deals. We can do all kinds of deals.

They can immediately come and bring an agentic layer or whatever, however you frame it, to immediately improve your functions here without you having to now hire an AI team to improve.

Therefore, the reason I'm saying that is you want to then pick on clients for whom GNA is big enough that it is worth optimizing for.

RevOps is big enough that it is worth optimizing for. So am I making sense to you? What you want to leave them with at the end is boss, talk to these guys, they will immediately improve XYZ for you.

The more simple you can make your offering to him, the easier it is for him to activate his network.

Yeah. Right. So like, for example, the guys I work with all early stage, none of them can work with you because for them, this is not a problem.

Yet. Correct.

[@12:31](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=751.841) \- **Vinay Mimani (Realfast)**

Right.

[@12:32](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=752.421) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

But when you look at, I forgot, I'm sorry, I don't have the list with me, but they have these larger companies for whom this is worth optimizing for.

Then the question is, how will you do it better than how I can do it? Because we can bring in XO, whatever you call it, you can call it XO, GNA, XO, RevOps, whatever it is.

And we immediately ingest all your existing content. Look at the way you work, context, look at the way you work as a company.

And within days, we will tell you where to improve.

[@12:57](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=777.161) \- **Vinay Mimani (Realfast)**

Correct. Okay.

[@12:58](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=778.341) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

Now. Thank Again, please take everything I say with a pinch of salt. The next move I would say because it has helped me with some equity guys and not again within my context is if I go and tell them I will revamp XYZ for them, that conversation takes a very long time.

Because they're like, boss, this seems like a complicated engagement. I need to have the headspace to deal with this.

I have other fires to fight. I twisted my message. Now I say, I come and say, boss, I'm going to work with you for four to six weeks on an audit basis.

I will come and solve a very micro problem for you. And then we can talk about a larger engagement.

Maybe one messaging that you guys can go with is, if you give me 10 clients, I immediately have an XO audit stage thing I can do for you.

Without you having to worry about a million dollar deal, I can start off with a more limited engagement that proves me to your portfolio, portfolio to me.

I don't know how you guys will do, what you can do as a limited taster engagement. I have found this useful with Kaushik and EQT in my experience.

Can you give an example?

[@13:56](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=836.201) \- **Vinay Mimani (Realfast)**

Can I ask you to make this a little more actionable? And it can be hypothetical also. So let's say GNA is the business function, right?

There could be multiple workflows in GNA itself, right? There's conciliation, there is dashboard insights for leadership and all of that, right?

Are you suggesting that we come up and say, because our messaging is aligned to something like that, that short, quick win to prove and then skip.

Correct. In your opinion, should we lay down some examples of workflows so that they also understand that, I understand the workflows with you.

Yes. Yes.

[@14:30](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=870.582) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

Because let's say I'm a portfolio company within EQT and I've now grown at the stage where it's in EQTs and see Kaushik is a very, what is in it for me as an investor, which is exit.

So when he connects me with the company for content, he's like, boss, I want you to do content only because I want them to raise a series B.

That's it. I don't care what happens otherwise. I just want them to use narrative to raise more money in your case, because you might be slightly more, it's, you know, can I get an exit?

Can I get a series G or whatever? I think it's good for you to go and say, look. look.

I've looked at these companies. This is a broad data that I'm showing. Some of the quick wins we can do are this.

can immediately tell you XYZ in your GNA function. We can immediately tell you where are you slowing down in your DevOps function.

And we will do this by combining our proprietary EXO framework, combining your data and our experience. All of this is important.

Like, because immediately a guy will think, boss, if I use LLM and I also put in the data, why can't I do what RealFast is doing?

[@15:27](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=927.202) \- **Vinay Mimani (Realfast)**

Correct.

[@15:27](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=927.742) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

But no, because RealFast adds an extra whatever. Sure. Again, this is where I'm just thinking because he is, at least in my experience with him, he's like, what can you do?

Do you have proof? Is there a model you are thinking? I'm going to connect you with this guy. What can you do for them immediately?

Right. And the one thing he's told me.

[@15:44](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=944.282) \- **Vinay Mimani (Realfast)**

Sorry. Go ahead. I'll park it for later.

[@15:46](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=946.942) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

And the one thing he's told me increasingly now, when I work with some of the content clients is, do your work before going.

He doesn't like, you need to be prepared when you have your first call with the guy. He you need

He expects you to kind of done half the discovery and so on. So anyway, this is my mode of engagement.

I don't want you to go to EQT if I were in your position and EQT is like, they can do anything for you.

Talk to them. I don't think that will be a good engagement. I think you need to say we can do these three things for this client.

This seems like the first thing to do. Let's go. And then I don't if this is useful, but no, no, absolutely.

[@16:28](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=988.922) \- **Vinay Mimani (Realfast)**

It is helping us also align in terms of how we were thinking. So tell me one thing, Sidin, generally, then he sends out those mails.

What is the kind of turnaround time from the, like these, these mails don't die out, right? There is a reciprocation.

Yeah. Follow through. Yeah.

[@16:46](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1006.76) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

He has connected me with Paid, PayRails, Albert and his own team. All four have come back to me. He's put me in touch with four people.

All came back. One, he immediately converted into a client. Terrible idea. Because they're actually not talked through or they.

They just wanted to keep going. And in all cases, he put me in touch with the CEO. And again, I'm not saying because I've now become friends with him.

So before the call, he'll actually call me up and say, this is how you'll convert this guy. I've told him this.

This is how you should convert. These are some insider tips on what they're struggling with. So he kind of matches what he thinks is an internal problem to what you can offer.

That's how my experience with Kaushik has been. Also, one thing to just keep in mind, Vinay, a little bit.

I don't know how this is. They now have portfolio companies that tackle parts of what their other portfolio companies are struggling.

To give you an example, they have a company called Stacks.ai that's purely focused on end of month closing for accounting teams.

Yeah.

[@17:45](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1065.12) \- **Vinay Mimani (Realfast)**

Right.

[@17:45](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1065.54) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

So I just don't want you to be competing with another portfolio company of theirs in the way you kind of frame yourself.

[@17:52](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1072.76) \- **Vinay Mimani (Realfast)**

Yeah, that is actually one of the objections we have. We are trying to prep for GNA. you. Thanks. As you said, right?

Stacks is there. That question might come. Hey, why will I not deploy this company for my other portfolio companies, right?

You're trying to come up with some good answer on that. You have like some kind of, and I know, I know, I know.

[@18:14](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1094.24) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

Again, my thinking is, if you're a large enough portfolio company, you need real fast before you get stacks is how I was thinking.

Now, tomorrow you bring in stacks. How does stacks work, man? Stacks has to plug into all your garbage data to make all of it work.

And stacks is optimizing for one part of your entire GNA process, which is closed. Realfast will come and tell you, close is actually this part of your problem.

Don't optimize for it. Something else needs optimizing. So there's both a diagnostic layer to what XO does and an activation layer to what XO does.

Am I making sense to you? So my thinking is, sure, go and get whatever SaaS product you need, but now you don't have to take the leap of faith to figure out which product you need.

XO will actually tell you where your weaknesses in your GNA system or in your EWOP system or wherever it is.

Kind of that, what do you call that diagnostic layer? And then stacks will say, actually, don't, sorry, XO might say, don't optimize for stacks.

Closing is not your problem. Something else is the problem. This is how I was kind of thinking about this a little bit.

[@19:17](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1157.06) \- **Vinay Mimani (Realfast)**

And, uh, uh, there were a couple of objections. I'm just running it through you because you understand how at least one of them things, right?

Uh, Kaushik, uh, I don't, we don't have a good read on Jeff. Uh, the other objection is, why should I go with a horizontal player?

Why can't I go with a vertical player, right? Someone who does FP\&A using agents. Why should I come to you?

Uh, do you have any thoughts on that? Like my question is what happens next?

[@19:44](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1184.78) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

You optimize for FP\&A. Now what?

[@19:47](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1187.84) \- **Vinay Mimani (Realfast)**

Yeah.

[@19:48](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1188.72) \- **Steven Sule**

This is where you go back to the actual thing where we're saying that like, dude, the, the real alpha will come when you optimize across the flow, not just one function.

Exactly. Right? That, So of the assembly line. Yeah.

[@20:04](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1204.28) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

I feel like in AI, especially, it becomes, especially in the way you guys are thinking about it, which is, sorry Vinay, I know context graph is no longer a buzzword.

It's gone. But my thinking is in some ways, what you're doing is you're building the context graph for a vertical function within a company, but building the foundations to actually horizontalize that context graph for the entire firm.

[@20:23](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1223.76) \- **Vinay Mimani (Realfast)**

Right? Yeah.

[@20:24](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1224.46) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

So you optimize your FPN and now what, how many stacks will you buy? Exactly. How many, how many point problems will you solve with AI?

Because then you're constantly playing a game about what the slowest part of my company, accelerate. Okay, next slowest, accelerate.

[@20:38](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1238.96) \- **Vinay Mimani (Realfast)**

Yeah.

[@20:39](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1239.1) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

You actually need the, in some, in some cases what you build, EXO is actually the enterprise-wide context graph company.

Anyway, that's a good point.

[@20:48](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1248.12) \- **Vinay Mimani (Realfast)**

No, and point solutions also create a lot of data silos, right? Extremely. Which is, anyway, is not going to help for a org-wide kind of business transformation or improve.

Let's go. Okay. To that, let's say this is the objection. This is our answer, right? Then I'm assuming he or she, I'm also trying to prep ourselves with this kind of line of questioning, right?

Asking you to play the devil's advocate. So then they will be like, okay, what, why do you have an alpha in horizontal play?

If you don't have, if you're not married to one single domain, right? Basically to that, we, the way we were articulating the answer is we have two things.

Number one, we have a roster of domain experts, which allows us to go into depth of a vertical company.

And we have the workflow plus context mapping suite of agents, which allows us to run that across the horizontal play and together with both of them together, you get the best of both, right?

You get vertical depth and horizontal scale. Is that something that works for me? It works for me.

[@21:52](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1312.88) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

So basically what you're saying, I'm just repeating what you're saying is that you've got vertical expertise, both in terms of people and tokens, by which means you.

You've got vertical token expertise and people expertise, and you've got horizontal people expertise and token expertise. So I know how to make the model work for FP\&A with experts in FP\&A.

I know how the model to work from sales to FP\&A and people there. So SIDU gives you horizontal expertise and tokenization of that.

And you've got vertical. So yeah, so that's why. And real fast, I think the story you want to tell is how did you get here?

Correct. We chose Salesforce, and I'm totally making this up. You chose Salesforce because Salesforce is the right mix of vertical and horizontal.

You need a fair amount of vertical. Salesforce the right mix of vertical and horizontal. You can't do a Salesforce SI until you can do both.

And what we realized was, man, the more Salesforce problems we solve, the more we realize we can commoditize this and this.

[@22:48](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1368.4) \- **Vinay Mimani (Realfast)**

That's a good point. No, no, that's a good point. I didn't think of that.

[@22:52](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1372.96) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

We pushed ourselves to see where can we do it at 30 million or 1 million, 30 K and 1 million.

Yes, we can do that also. Yeah. Right. But we are not promising that all of this will happen for a customer tomorrow, but until I can prove to you at vertical levels, you will not trust me to solve it for a horizontal level across a company.

So give us a bunch of customers for whom we can solve one or two key vertical problems and prove it.

[@23:17](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1397.28) \- **Vinay Mimani (Realfast)**

Yeah. And these are the verticals we think will have the best payback period for you, right? Because you have pointed out pressure and all of that.

there are the portfolio companies for that.

[@23:26](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1406.52) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

Then they might ask you, show me your FP\&A experts. They go, show me your rev ops experts. They go, and you can say, look, I'm building one expertise every quarter.

[@23:33](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1413.6) \- **Vinay Mimani (Realfast)**

That is the point where it might break down because we don't actually have that roster of experts right now, to be honest with you.

Right. But I mean, if they ask, we'll have to say something, but yeah, it's not there right now as such.

Again, I have no idea what they're going to ask you, but I'm just responding.

[@23:55](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1435.12) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

Don't say that according to plan.

[@23:59](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1439.2) \- **Vinay Mimani (Realfast)**

No, no, this is. And then, and then I think this highlight, right?

[@24:03](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1443.72) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

mean, take a 30k deal where we went X, we went crosswise and now look at this boardroom deal where we've gone crosswise.

Yeah.

[@24:13](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1453.28) \- **Vinay Mimani (Realfast)**

I've actually extracted some anecdotes from like, basically I have some proof points, which I'll throw in as anecdotes after any claim, right?

that it lands an impact. I'm just also running it by you. Tell me if that makes sense. One of the proof point when we talk about verticalization is we went into a PE back.

platform with, let's say, I think more than 100 mil revenue. And our agents were able to extract the domain expertise from a 5 million plus line of code base in a week.

And our agents were able to tell us this about the system, which the system owner of 20 years didn't know about.

[@24:46](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1486.16) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

So that is one proof point, which kind of talks about how you say, you want to say that, just being devil's advocate, you want to say, okay, we went to a customer, 100 million revenue, they had this code base.

This is how quickly we ingested their contacts with our expertise. This is what we discovered. This is how their business has changed because of this.

You want to kind of connect it to that last bit as well. Like we are not, EXO is not finding things for the heck of it, but this is the business.

[@25:15](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1515.78) \- **Vinay Mimani (Realfast)**

Yeah. Yeah. That's the tricky. No, what you're saying is right. The tricky part is it's still in flight, right?

We have actually not delivered, but I can figure out a way to connect into some business outcome right now.

Maybe it has accelerated the rate of delivery of that.

[@25:30](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1530.66) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

And the beauty is, and I was telling Steve last time, you, all your stories should be on a timeline because of speed.

Correct. So you say day zero, we wrote contract day one. We ingested the code base day three. discovered the fall day four.

Now we're working on a project. took us five days to do something that they had not noticed in years.

[@25:46](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1546.98) \- **Vinay Mimani (Realfast)**

Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Okay. So that is good. Or that is, that is one of the proof points. The other proof point is more around one objection, which they might come up with is.

Why can't I go to Perficient, right? They have bought in that $3 billion company. So there are two proof points there.

One is that we actually fought head on with a 30 mil PE backed SI on Agentforce implementation, AI transformation.

We came out of that with much better implementation and speed. So that is kind of showing them like a head on win rate.

Uh, the other is we are talking to, uh, SI right now, one, 1 billion plus run rate, uh, and they are trying to learn how to transform their own services from us.

Uh, so these are the two proof points. Does that kind of land? Yeah, it does.

[@26:40](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1600.24) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

That's because you're pure play. I think, I don't know what Perficient, but what would you say that? Perficient is a SI, but very large enterprise SI, GSI.

[@26:49](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1609.34) \- **Vinay Mimani (Realfast)**

Yeah. Yeah.

[@26:50](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1610.22) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

I think the, what you should do is, I mean, one thing you could say is that you're actually pure play.

is what you do. Like you are built from day zero. You're not a. You SI that picked up AI when it became cool.

Exactly. Yeah, you are a, you are a bunch of domain experts who had both horizontal and vertical expertise who said, now, what if we overlaid everything we could do with the cutting state of the art models?

Oh my God, look at the force multiplication.

[@27:16](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1636.28) \- **Vinay Mimani (Realfast)**

Correct.

[@27:17](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1637.0) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

So, and also what is good for you is on the one hand, are like cutting edge, your state of the art, we're happening there.

We also have guys who work with mainframe.

[@27:27](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1647.42) \- **Vinay Mimani (Realfast)**

So we understand what we're getting into.

[@27:29](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1649.08) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

So it's not like, we are not kids. Yeah. I would say that would be your, that would be your, and you are, your company is growing on the basis of your philosophy.

Like you're not just dogfooding it for the heck of it. Exactly.

[@27:43](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1663.54) \- **Vinay Mimani (Realfast)**

Exactly. Yeah.

[@27:44](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1664.76) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

You're like, Cloud Code is using Cloud Code to build Cloud Code. Realfast is using XO to build XO. You know what I mean?

[@27:50](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1670.72) \- **Vinay Mimani (Realfast)**

Correct.

[@27:51](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1671.26) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

The only reason I feel like it might come back to, so is XO a product or a platform? That is something you might want to think about a little bit.

[@27:58](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1678.6) \- **Vinay Mimani (Realfast)**

Yeah. think is think You

[@29:00](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1740.0) \- **Steven Sule**

about yourself as an AI first IT services business, right? Somebody that can do all of these things for you.

And the only difference is going back to our original conversation is that the time compression that you're willing to, that you're able to do, and the friction to revenue metric that you talked about, that reduces considerably, which is why you're able to deliver this like output to them in a meaningful manner.

[@29:27](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1767.64) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

Yes, and for one of these portfolio companies, it's not so much friction to revenue, given the functions you're looking at, it's friction to savings.

Yes. Now, if you wanted to optimize your GNA with anybody else, with a pure play IT services company, it's going to take you five times the time, many, many more people, your office swarming with consultants.

Yeah.

[@29:48](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1788.36) \- **Steven Sule**

Instead, Realfast… Actually, funnily enough, like Huron themselves, when we had that call the other day, they actually quoted saying that, man, when we run managed services, five-year contracts, it takes us three…

Here's to come up to speed with what grew and the last two years is when we actually are able to deliver some value.

That is the actual wording. That is finished.

[@30:14](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1814.22) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

EXO will compress the EXO plus your people will compress the first three years into three weeks.

[@30:21](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1821.0) \- **Steven Sule**

Yes.

[@30:24](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1824.98) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

So again, the only reason is you could, I mean, you could play it like, okay. Is EXO the finical to Realfast the Infosys?

I don't know. I've been thinking about this a lot for the last two, three days. Like, do you want to say, look, we are EXO GNA, EXO RevOps or whatever.

Are these like point solutions for the services business? I don't know. I'm just thinking about this a little bit.

Who knows? may not even come up.

[@30:53](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1853.94) \- **Vinay Mimani (Realfast)**

I mean, if you think of coupling that with the roster of domain expertise, in their hands, it does become kind

But yeah, if they believe that, yeah, in a way, then it becomes that, yes.

[@31:08](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1868.24) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

Again, may or may not come up, but again.

[@31:12](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1872.38) \- **Vinay Mimani (Realfast)**

Can you think of any objections, given you've already seen how equity works, their internal dynamics and all of that, any objection that you think we have not covered from vertical, horizontal, internal portfolio companies, service and other portfolio companies, or, you know, any curveball that you think they're going to go.

I don't know who Jeff is.

[@31:31](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1891.96) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

I can tell you some of their internal dynamics, which is they are increasingly trying to de-link EQT ventures from the rest of EQT, because the rest is seen as being very slow and ventures wants to move very quickly.

And I think I'm not 100% certain on this Vinay, but the sense I got from my chat, somebody there was Devas Kaushik to essentially start driving EQT ventures out of London.

And their focus is, can we rapidly move much faster than the rest of EQT because they've got private debt.

So I'm aware of Siddhu and I think there's an element of respect there. It was a very long time.

[@33:07](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1987.0) \- **Steven Sule**

Siddhu maybe.

[@33:08](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=1988.38) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

Yeah. So, uh, uh, he's a guy who's comfortable with abstraction, but at the end of the day, he's very proof.

He's like, can you do it? Do you have this thing? Will you make me look like a fool in front of my portfolio companies because they are very busy.

I don't want to waste their time. So I would be like super, how can I end this conversation with Kaushik sending in two paragraph emails to top portfolio companies?

**ACTION ITEM: Research EQT Ventures funding stages (post-Series A/B) for Vinay/Steven \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=2010.9999)**

[@33:35](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=2015.56) \- **Vinay Mimani (Realfast)**

Yeah. Got it. Oh, yeah. Makes sense. Do you have an idea in terms of what stage, like which series, uh, do they fund equity ventures?

[@33:48](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=2028.3) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

That I don't know. I was doing a little bit of a check. Uh, yeah. I'll also do that.

[@33:53](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=2033.84) \- **Vinay Mimani (Realfast)**

Yeah. also just go through, go through the list I have.

[@33:58](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=2038.12) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

Um, yeah. He is video. Yeah. Aggressively looking at, he wants to get in very early in general. Toshik likes to get in early because they've even done very, very high levels.

I think they did a 21 million seed for paid.ai and they've done a bunch of single digit million dollar.

He is willing to put out his neck and support interesting founders. I don't, but he's also a little bit new, Vinay.

He's only been in EQT for two years now. Three years, two, two years, something. Also, he is extreme fintech.

Like the guy is very, very, very fintech because of Stripe. And a lot of money he's put into companies are people in various stages of fintech and agentic payments and normal payments and pay rails and stuff like that.

They all hold him in high regard. mean, they seem to think that he's a non-nonsense. I'll also do a little bit of research to figure out what their post series A, series B looks like.

My sense is, you know, you want to work with companies where optimizing for GMA and DevOps will make a material difference to them.

Exactly.

[@36:00](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=2160.01) \- **Vinay Mimani (Realfast)**

If I'm blocking time, we can get Sidin also on the call, I mean, that's why Sundays, I don't know, Sidin, bro, I'm not gonna bring you on Sunday, but Usually, it's not a problem, but I'm actually traveling with family tomorrow, Vinay.

**ACTION ITEM: Review EQT portfolio list; send feedback to Steven/Vinay \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=2161.9999)**

[@36:12](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=2172.73) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

But what you do is share it with me. Yes. I'm going to Valencia with family. Share it with me.

I will go through it and give you any feedback if you need. You're going where?

[@36:22](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=2182.87) \- **Steven Sule**

Valencia. Oh, wow.

[@36:24](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=2184.75) \- **Vinay Mimani (Realfast)**

Dude, you're saying Valencia as if it's HSR layout or something, right? Because it's 20 degrees there, man.

[@36:32](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=2192.73) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

20 degrees. That's the only reason it's warm there.

[@36:37](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=2197.41) \- **Vinay Mimani (Realfast)**

Amazing, man. Where are you based out of right now?

[@36:39](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=2199.67) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

London, London. I live in a suburb of London. Super green family.

[@36:45](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=2205.79) \- **Vinay Mimani (Realfast)**

Amazing. Amazing. Awesome. Thank you so much, Sidin.

[@36:49](https://fathom.video/calls/565430929?timestamp=2209.83) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

This was really helpful. I hope it is, man. Again, I cannot predict what you'll run up with these guys when you meet them, but I hope it goes well.

And Steve, just send whatever, man. And I'll give you... Thank
