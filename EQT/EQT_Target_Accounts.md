# EQT Target Accounts
## Curated Shortlist — Post-Kaushik Call (February 25, 2026)

---

## Selection Criteria

Filtered from 270+ EQT portfolio companies using:
- **Company Scoring Framework** (max 7): Salesforce Presence (0-2) + Finance Headcount bins (0-5)
- **Operational Complexity**: Multi-site, multi-country operations with high back-office friction
- **SI Displacement Opportunity**: Companies almost certainly paying traditional IT services firms today
- **Kaushik's Direction**: "Keep it to 5-10, focused" — curated with a thesis for each
- **Review Engine Filters**: Persona compression (CIO/CFO as pain + budget owner), proof velocity (4-6 week deliverable), wedge sharpness (specific function, specific metric)

## Target Accounts (7 Companies)

| # | Company | Region | Score (/7) | Finance HC | Industry | The Play |
|---|---------|--------|------------|------------|----------|----------|
| 1 | **SSP Group** | UK | 5 | 343 | Travel F&B | ~2,000 units across 600+ locations in 40 countries. Massive multi-site ops requiring supplier coordination, staffing allocation, location P&L management. High-volume, repetitive back-office across dispersed sites. |
| 2 | **IVC Evidensia** | UK | 5 | 308 | Veterinary Services | 2,500 clinics across 20 countries, 41K employees. Each clinic semi-independent — dispersed billing, scheduling, supply chain, HR. Classic franchise-model back-office complexity. |
| 3 | **Magnit Global** | US | 6 | 340 | Workforce Management | Contingent workforce management in 160 countries. Supplier coordination, client program ops, compliance tracking. Rules-heavy, process-intensive operations. |
| 4 | **VFS Global** | UAE | 5 | 249 | Visa Services | 100K+ visa applications daily for 69 governments in 147 countries. Document processing at massive scale. Operational wedge is clear — high-volume, rules-based document ops and scheduling. |
| 5 | **WS Audiology** | SG | 7 | 287 | Manufacturing | Global hearing aid manufacturer (Widex, Signia, Rexton). €2.63B revenue across 125 countries. Procurement, reconciliation, supply chain across geographies. Highest score in portfolio. |
| 6 | **Nord Anglia Education** | UK | 6 | 176 | Education | 89 international schools in 37 countries, 100K+ students. Multi-country HR, finance, facilities management. G&A at scale with significant geographic dispersion. |
| 7 | **First Student** | US | 6 | 170 | Transportation | Largest school bus operator in North America, 50K employees, 500+ locations. Dispatch, driver management, contract admin, route optimization. High-volume operational logistics. |

## Why These Seven

Each company passes four tests:

1. **Operational, not tech** — These are companies where the core business is physical/operational. They will not build AI internally. They need someone to come in and do it.
2. **Multi-site complexity** — Dispersed operations create back-office friction that scales with every new location/country. Point solutions cannot address this.
3. **SI displacement** — At this scale, these companies are spending millions on IT services firms (Accenture, Cognizant, Wipro, Perficient, etc.) for system integration, process automation, and operational tooling. The question for EQT: are they getting value for that spend?
4. **CIO as proof point owner** — In each case, the CIO/COO can articulate the pain and owns the budget. Persona compression is tight. No committee buying.

## Companies Cut (with reasoning)

### Removed from Original List

| Company | Reason for Removal |
|---------|-------------------|
| **PropertyGuru Group** | PropTech/marketplace company — tech-native, would build internally. No SI displacement opportunity. |
| **Virtuos Games** | Gaming services company — tech workforce, engineering-led. Would adopt AI tools directly, not hire us. |
| **Dechra Pharmaceuticals** | Veterinary pharma — regulatory complexity adds friction without proof velocity. Scored 6/7 but pharma deal cycles are long and compliance-heavy. |
| **Zegna Group** | Luxury fashion — brand-driven, not operations-driven. No clear operational wedge. G&A is not the pain point; brand and retail experience is. |
| **Unum** | Fortune 500 insurer — regulated industry, committee-based procurement. Deal cycle would be 12-18 months minimum. No quick proof of value path. |
| **Solera** | Automotive SaaS — scored 7/7 but is fundamentally a software company. Would build AI capabilities internally. We compete with their product team, not serve their ops. |
| **Storable** | Self-storage SaaS — same as Solera. Software company that would build, not buy. |
| **Waystar** | Healthcare payments SaaS — scored 7/7 but is a tech company. Also healthcare regulatory overlay. |
| **Wellhub** | Corporate wellness platform (ex-Gympass) — tech-native, would build internally. |
| **Levande** | Australian senior living — scored 4/7. Too small (58 villages, 33 finance HC). Below the threshold for meaningful proof point. |

### Previously Reviewed and Excluded

| Company | Reason for Exclusion |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Perficient** | IT services/consulting firm ($2.8B). While Kaushik flagged acute pain, Perficient is a services company where time-to-value is a concern — typical engagement cycles with services companies are arduous. Longer deal cycles do not align with demonstrating quick proof of value. More importantly, Perficient is the type of company realfast is built to displace, not serve. |
| **Credila** | Indian financial services. Less aligned with current ICP. Longer deal cycles anticipated. |
| **Cast & Crew** | Entertainment payroll (scored 6/7, 213 finance HC). Reviewed in depth — complex rules-based processing is interesting but entertainment industry procurement cycles and union considerations add friction to proof velocity. |

## Regional Distribution

| Region | Companies | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| UK | SSP, IVC Evidensia, Nord Anglia | Kaushik's home base (London). Strongest for initial intro. |
| US | Magnit Global, First Student | Jeff Lu's territory (Growth team). |
| UAE | VFS Global | Asia-adjacent. Could go to either Kaushik or Jeff. |
| SG | WS Audiology | Highest-scoring company in portfolio (7/7). Singapore HQ — natural for Asia-Pac engagement. |

## Recommended Lead Companies

**For Kaushik (UK/Ventures):** SSP Group, IVC Evidensia — both UK-based, both with 300+ finance headcount, both with clear multi-site operational wedge.

**For Jeff (Asia-Pac/Growth):** WS Audiology (SG), VFS Global (UAE) — highest scores in the Asia region, clear operational complexity.

**Best single proof point candidate:** SSP Group — 343 finance headcount, 2,000 units, 40 countries. The back-office friction is enormous and visible. A 4-6 week engagement on supplier coordination or location P&L management would produce a measurable delta that Kaushik can see.
