# WHO WE'RE TALKING TO

## Kaushik Subramanian — Partner, EQT Ventures (London)

- Ex-Stripe (built FX/multicurrency into 9-figure revenue), Ex-Meta (ads ecosystem), Ex-McKinsey
- Invests in AI and fintech. Portfolio includes: Paid.ai, Stacks.ai, Payrails, Beside
- **Personality**: BSD who pretends MSD. Huge soft corner for Indian tech. Very little time for BS. Particularly likes people who show rather than tell. Doesn't care for bullshit. Very focused.
- **Operating mindset**: Doesn't like being a VC deep down. Prefers operating. Engages with operational things better than bs.
- **How he evaluates**: "He's going to look at your team and think — are these guys worth betting on? Do they have a track record? He's not going to say, do you have the tech in place? He's going to say, **what are your hypotheses? What bets are you making? What vectors do you see changing?** And then: **how am I going to make money off you guys?** He's taking a bet not on the disruption itself, but on the people who can manage that disruption." — Sidin
- **AI thesis**: Believes AI will disrupt things but doesn't know how or when. Taking bets on two extreme ends — massive disruption AND specific point disruptions (Stacks.ai for closing, Paid.ai for payments). Playing the full game because he doesn't know if the disruption will be small, medium, or large.
- **His value as connector**: When convinced, he sends 2-paragraph emails to portfolio company CEOs. Has done this for Sidin — connected him with Paid, Payrails, Albert, and his own team. All came back. In all cases, put Sidin in touch with the CEO.
- **Holds Sidu in high regard.**

## Jeff Lu — Managing Director, EQT Growth (Hong Kong)

- Ex-Morgan Stanley HK, founded Princeville Capital (Asia-Pac growth + climate tech)
- Focus: software and industrial technology
- Stanford BA, Wharton MBA
- **Unknown quantity.** No one has a read on Jeff. He's Growth team — his portfolio companies are later-stage, exactly where G&A/RevOps friction is material.

# THIS IS NOT A FUNDRAISING CALL

We want portfolio companies to work with. The framing:
- We're asking for distribution, not capital
- "Give us a distribution node to prove that this disruption is happening in real time" — Steve
- Thereafter we either become interesting from an investment POV or as a game changer for their portcos

# THE THESIS — YOUR HYPOTHESES (What Kaushik Wants to Hear)

## 1. The CIO Dilemma

CIOs across enterprise are under extreme pressure to do something with AI. The board is asking. The fund is asking. Competitors are announcing. But these are people who were hired into what was fundamentally a **procurement role**.

For decades, IT was a buying decision — evaluate vendors, purchase licenses, manage contracts. Building internally was never realistic. The CIO's expertise was in choosing the right product, not building the right solution.

That world is gone. What was traditionally a procurement decision is now something fundamentally different — and there is no clarity, no playbook, no ability for most CIOs to even begin to navigate the minefield that is AI transformation. They don't know where the friction actually is. They don't know whether to buy or build. They don't know which vendor is solving the right problem versus selling a solution to the wrong one.

The result: CIOs are buying point solutions — one for FP&A, one for closing, one for support — and playing a perpetual game of whack-a-mole. Optimise one function, discover the bottleneck moved. Nobody is doing the diagnostic work first.

## 2. Sidu's Thesis: There Is No Product

This is core to how we think about the market, and it's part of our foundational thesis.

Software has shifted from being an **asset** (expensive and risky to build, which is why you buy products) to **inventory** (cheap and easy to manufacture, which means the question becomes *what* to build).

**The old model**: Building software was hard, so buying products made sense. The CIO's job was to evaluate vendors and manage contracts. SaaS companies captured value because the difficulty of building created scarcity. The moat was the difficulty itself.

**What's changed**: AI has collapsed the line between "buy" and "build." Software below a certain complexity threshold is now trivially buildable. That line only moves in one direction — every model generation pushes it higher.

**What this means for the CIO**: The traditional playbook (identify problem → evaluate vendors → purchase product) is broken. You can now build most of what you'd buy — cheaper, faster, and tailored to your actual workflow. But the CIO doesn't have the capability to do this. They were hired for the old model.

**What this means for us**: realfast is the execution capability that CIOs need but can't hire. We're not a product they buy (there IS no product for this). We're not consultants who give them a roadmap. We come in, diagnose where friction actually exists, and build working solutions in weeks. That diagnostic-plus-activation layer is what's missing everywhere.

**The key line**: "Every point solution optimises one function. We tell you which function actually needs optimising — and then we build it."

# THE INSURANCE POLICY FRAMING (Sidin's Strategic Insight)

Kaushik is investing on both ends of disruption:
- **Series A bets** (Stacks.ai, Paid.ai): these are the disruptors — AI-native companies attacking specific verticals
- **Growth portfolio** (SSP, Nord Anglia, WS Audiology, First Student): these are the companies vulnerable to that disruption

> "You want to say: look, we are going to **prevent your Series B and C guys from getting disrupted by your Series A guys.**" — Sidin

realfast is the insurance policy. We come into the growth portfolio companies and make sure they're not left behind while the AI-native startups eat their lunch. We do this by finding where the friction actually is and building solutions in weeks — not by asking them to buy another point solution.

---

# THE KILLER LINE

Steve: *"Half my mind to tell Kaushik — bro, you believe in IT services being disrupted yes or no. If no, you have the buying opportunity of a generation with the stocks where they are and they are liquid."*

**Sidin: "Just say this. Just say this. He will appreciate the candour."**

# HOW TO RUN THE CALL

## 1. Open with Candour (2 min)

> "Kaushik, simple question. You believe IT services is being disrupted — yes or no? Because if no, the stocks are where they are and they're liquid — buying opportunity of a generation. If yes — that's what we're here to talk about. We're not asking for investment. We're asking you to give us portfolio companies to prove this disruption is happening in real time."

## 2. Your Hypotheses (3 min)

This is what Kaushik wants to hear — not a pitch, but how you think:

> "Here's what we believe. CIOs are under extreme pressure to transform with AI, but they were hired for a fundamentally different job — procurement. Buying software. Managing vendors. That playbook is broken. Software has gone from asset to inventory — it's cheap to build now. The hard part isn't the technology. The hard part is knowing what to build and where.
>
> Every portfolio company is buying point solutions — one for FP&A, one for closing, one for support — and the bottleneck just moves. Nobody is doing the diagnostic work first. That's the gap. We fill it."

## 3. The Insurance Policy (2 min)

> "Your Series A bets — Stacks, Paid — they're building the disruption. Your growth portfolio — SSP, WS Audiology, Nord Anglia — they're the ones who need to survive it. We're the team that makes sure your bigger companies don't get left behind. We come in, find where the friction is, and build working solutions in weeks."

## 4. The Portfolio Analysis (5 min)

Walk through the scoring. Show the homework. This is the "show" that Kaushik respects.

> "We analysed your portfolio. Scored companies on G&A headcount and technology footprint. After filtering, your highest-opportunity targets are companies like SSP, IVC Evidensia, and WS Audiology — large, multi-site operations with hundreds of people in back-office functions. These are the companies where a 4-6 week engagement moves a real number."

Name 3-5 companies. Be specific about which function and what quick win you'd target.

## 5. The Ask (3 min)

> "Pick one of these companies. Give us one workflow — G&A, RevOps, support — and one business metric. We'll diagnose where the real friction is and deliver a measurable delta in 4-6 weeks. If we don't move the metric, we don't invoice. The cost of testing this is trivial. The information value is significant."

# THE EMAIL TEST

Everything said should enable this 2-paragraph email from Kaushik/Jeff to a portco CEO:

> *"I met with the Realfast team. They've analysed our portfolio and identified where operational friction is highest. They specialise in diagnosing where AI can actually move a business metric — G&A, RevOps, support — and delivering a working solution in weeks. They've done it at $30K and $1M. If they don't deliver, they don't charge. Your company scored high on their analysis. Worth a 30-minute call."*

# OBJECTION HANDLING

| If they say... | You say... |
|---|---|
| "Why not Perficient?" | "Run us side by side. Same company, same workflow, same timeline. Let the results speak." |
| "Why not Stacks.ai for closing?" | "We come in before you know whether Stacks is the right answer. We diagnose where the friction actually is. Closing might not be the bottleneck." |
| "Is Exo a product?" | "Exo is how we deliver faster than anyone else. The portco gets a working solution, not a platform install." |
| "This sounds like consulting" | "Consultants give you a roadmap. We ship a working system in weeks. No decks, no maturity assessments." |
| "We need to loop in EQT Digital" | "Happy to align with them. Our scope is execution — zero overlap with strategy or advisory." |
| "Why can't they just do this themselves?" | "Because the CIO was hired to buy software, not build AI solutions. That capability doesn't exist inside most companies. We are that capability." |
| "Why horizontal, not vertical?" | "You optimise FP&A. Now what? The next bottleneck. And the next. You're playing a perpetual game. We build the diagnostic layer that tells you where to focus — then we build vertically within that." |
| "What's your track record?" | Timeline it: "Day zero, contract signed. Day one, ingested the codebase. Day three, discovered issues the system owner of 20 years didn't know about. Day five, working system deployed." |

# WHAT NOT TO DO

| Don't | Why |
|---|---|
| Pitch a slide deck | Kaushik prefers operators. Show, don't tell. |
| Lead with technology or Exo architecture | He's evaluating people and hypotheses, not tech. |
| Be vague — "we can do anything" | Sidin: "I don't want you to go to EQT and say they can do anything for you." Name companies, functions, outcomes. |
| Mention fundraising | This is about portco work. Period. |
| Compete with Stacks.ai | It's his investment. Position as diagnostic layer that comes BEFORE point solutions. |
| Mention the Motherbrain play | Phase 2. Earn it first. |
| Be tentative | He appreciates candour. Say what you believe. |
