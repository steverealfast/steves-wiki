[@1:01](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=61.32) \- **stevensule**

I heard they renamed your state.

[@1:05](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=65.62) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

My seat. Your state. It's called Keralam.

[@1:10](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=70.56) \- **stevensule**

Keralam. Very good. That's why the right is right.

[@1:19](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=79.4) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Have you seen the Malayalia video? Please send it to me. Let me get offended once before I get to offend.

[@1:26](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=86.08) \- **stevensule**

It's almost as good as the Kurgi video when they dance. Yeah, that's also pretty good.

[@1:33](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=93.3) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Both of these are like Kukkong boys from where I live.

[@1:39](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=99.9) \- **stevensule**

By the way, Vinay, have you met Sidin in person? This is Sidin in person.

[@1:46](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=106.2) \- **Vinay Mimani**

I know. Hi, Sidin, man. How long are you here?

[@1:50](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=110.18) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

By the way, please meet Hamzan.

[@1:52](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=112.16) \- **stevensule**

Hamzan.

[@1:55](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=115.9) \- **Vinay Mimani**

How long are you here? get till Friday morning. You can't say lagga, ya.

[@5:05](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=305.18) \- **stevensule**

Hamza? Hamza, you talk to me in person? No? How sad.

[@5:13](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=313.12) \- **Vinay Mimani**

I'm bang, man. No, no. I'm just thinking about that graphic, Claudia Larson. Must have.

[@5:23](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=323.28) \- **stevensule**

Dude, let's get this out quickly, dude.

[@5:25](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=325.76) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Yeah. No, I mean, I'm going to come back to you for like a 2 lakh budget on this.

[@5:32](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=332.48) \- **stevensule**

2 lakh? 2 lakh is fine, as long as it's not dollars, bro. Rupees, I can handle.

[@5:36](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=336.74) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

No, no. 2 lakh rupees. It's a lot of t-shirts. That's why we did this in Gojek, no? 2 lakhs goes a long way on this.

[@5:49](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=349.32) \- **stevensule**

Sidin, you had dosa or no?

[@5:52](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=352.24) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

No, I haven't had some. I've not done much eating on this trip so far.

[@5:56](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=356.16) \- **stevensule**

But you only landed yesterday.

[@5:58](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=358.56) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Yeah, yeah. I just had like... I did the hotel and stuff.

[@6:00](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=360.96) \- **stevensule**

I had two meetings in the evening after landing. Oh.

[@6:04](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=364.06) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

So I finished off both. I'm now half an hour late for my next meeting. When are you trapping back?

Friday morning. Friday back to 1 o'clock at night. No, no, Bye.

[@6:16](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=376.08) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Hi, guys. Sorry, I'm five minutes late. I had to deal with transport for London this morning.

[@6:22](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=382.06) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

It's all good, man. We'll spend the next 20 minutes tilting you about it.

[@6:25](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=385.4) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

That's fine. You can spend 45\. We have 45\. I can even go over.

[@6:28](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=388.68) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

No, no, no. Nobody here is punctual except Steve.

[@6:31](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=391.46) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Okay. It's in also, I think. I just want to say hello. Oh, hi, man. What's up? Good to see you.

[@6:36](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=396.06) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

What are you doing there? They had a lot of doubts about how to use AI.

[@6:40](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=400.28) \- **stevensule**

So I was just explaining.

[@6:42](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=402.04) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Of course. I actually introduced him to someone at the company for the first time and I'm like, okay, how do I introduce him?

[@6:49](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=409.02) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

I'm like, he's a fractional CMO. Nice. I usually just send people his blog, which I think is quite underwritten nowadays.

That book is also underrated, but it's a high effort task for someone to do for an introduction.

[@7:16](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=436.64) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

So that's why I send a blog. Okay, Mathis, enjoy. Nice meeting tomorrow. Kaushik, see you.

[@7:24](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=444.96) \- **stevensule**

Before AGI.

[@7:27](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=447.2) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

No, no, no, we will definitely meet before AGI. See you guys. Bye. See you.

[@7:37](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=457.62) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Cool. Hi, it's nice. Sidhu, I think we know each other from Twitter. chatted a lot. Yeah, exactly. But we haven't ever spoken.

So it's nice to kind of put a moving picture to the name. So I don't know, how should we do this?

Should I maybe do a quick round of intros on my side? I can tell you about EQT. I don't know what's most helpful.

[@7:59](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=479.52) \- **stevensule**

I mean, I think... we know about EQT and we've sort of worked with, we've had a long conversation with Jeff and with Samir, right, Vinay, last year when we were sort of engaging with them on their Salesforce portfolio specifically because I'm happy to like sort of do a quick round of intros between the three of us if that helps.

[@8:22](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=502.161) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Yeah, sure. Absolutely. Did Jeff tell you about the ventures program as well?

[@8:26](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=506.121) \- **stevensule**

No, we haven't spent any time with him on that. We were just looking at predominantly as a sort of angle to work with some of the portfolio companies.

[@8:33](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=513.161) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Got it. I'll tell you a little bit about that and also what Jeff and I are doing because we're technically in different teams but we're working together.

So I'll tell you a bit about that. So just so you have context on that as well. So I'll keep it short.

I'm a product person turned investor. My specialty is in building Silicon Valley style product teams and growing those to billion dollars plus in scale.

I've done that two times. First time was at Meta where we came up with a new way for app developers to make money.

We grew it to a five billion dollar business in two years. And then. Then IDFA happened, so we saw that come crashing down.

So saw both sides of hyper-sailing. Second time was at Stripe, where I used to run a number of product teams, but my most notable achievement there was monetizing an unmonetized corridor and calling it a new product, which eventually grew to 10 billion in TPV with a 60 whip stake rate.

So it was quite a profitable product at Stripe. Stripe doesn't know how to make, at least at the time, did not know how to make money.

So I got in some Facebook DNA into that org. I've been helping founders for a while, mainly on product, and then started writing angel checks, did some terrible investments, learned how to be an angel investor, and then started doing some decent investments, at least on paper.

And then joined EQT Ventures three years ago as a partner based in London. EQT Ventures, part of EQT, independent fund.

Each fund is independent, has its own ICO and LPs. Ventures started in 2016 with the idea that European entrepreneurs should not have to go to SF to raise.

So it's high conviction, series A capital, check size. From 2 to 50 million, with an average check size of 15\.

Companies we've invested in that have been successful are Volt Food Delivery, we led the Series A, it sold for DoorDash for 8 billion, it was the largest VC exit in Europe.

We did Pecon, which sold to Workday. Recently we did Sana, which sold to Workday also for a billion. Small Giant Games, Banking Circle, it's a 4-5 billion dollar company now, Clio, more recently Parlowa, which is Contact Center AI, just raised at 3.5 billion.

We led the Series A. So that's kind of some of the portfolio. So mainly focused on Europe and the US.

Increasingly, at least for the last year and a half, two years, I've been pushing EQT to do more in India.

Jeff is part of an Asia Growth Fund, and together, we're working together, trying to see if we can do some deals in India, Southeast Asia, that corridor, more on the growth side of things.

So, like early growth, or what in Asia is mid-growth. So like $15 million check types.

[@11:03](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=663.381) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Cool.

[@11:06](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=666.261) \- **stevensule**

Sidhu, you want to go?

[@11:08](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=668.101) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Yeah, mean, you know, usual long story, right? IT services, product, back to services. Then chat GPT dropped, realized that the whole services thing is up in the air.

[@11:20](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=680.641) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Yeah.

[@11:21](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=681.321) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Yeah, I mean, yeah, we've chatted enough, I think.

[@11:24](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=684.561) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Yeah, I have context.

[@11:25](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=685.801) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

think it's the other guys who should go.

[@11:27](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=687.221) \- **stevensule**

Very quickly, the non-technical person in the room, very simply was started my career in finance, banking, M\&A work across India, the UK, and in Singapore.

Pivoted to sort of becoming an early stage investor when early stage was still not a big thing here before Surgeon all came into play.

Followed Sidhu's and Akash's story from the sidelines because I went to school with Nadeem, who was the co-founder of Gojek.

And just became friends with Sidhu actually. name. So, at the of Always wanted to work with him. Got the opportunity at Realfast, so I'll look after finance and all things operational.

[@12:08](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=728.501) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

He was also the first check-in to Realfast, long before we ever thought of raising venture capital. We were originally supposed to be like a pure blue star thing.

[@12:17](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=737.361) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

He was the first check-in. Nice, nice.

[@12:20](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=740.561) \- **stevensule**

Vinay.

[@12:21](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=741.561) \- **Vinay Mimani**

Hey, yeah. Hi, Kaushik. Great to meet you. I'm a product-turned-founder-turned-salesperson. Earlier had worked at Twitter, then worked at Gojek.

I was heading the marketplace product there. Sidhu Akash were actually my bosses there. And then after that, did a stint of my own AI sales company as a founder, and then recently joined around a year back as head of GTM at Realfast.

[@12:43](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=763.961) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Nice. Super nice to meet all of you. I know the company from the website and some notes that I've seen.

I'd love to hear from you because I remember, Sidhu, when you started, you started with like, this was pre-AI salesforce implementation, if I'm not wrong.

That's right.

[@13:02](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=782.601) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

This is like GPT-3-5, right? Like it was very painful business.

[@13:07](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=787.161) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I also remember like, I don't know if you exchanged notes on it or someone else told me that you were only going to do bootstrapped.

So I'm keen to like hear how the journey was like journey has been so far.

[@13:23](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=803.321) \- **stevensule**

So like kind of the market at the moment just telling you where our thesis originally began from, right? We saw IT services as being ripe for disruption as and when the advent of AI came into play.

Sidu and Akash very much focused on doing this consulting-led sort of services business as bootstrapped business. Once they were done with Gojek, because they had the connections within this part of the world, Series B, C and D founders were very happy to engage with them.

And there was a very profitable kind of business model running for them. I think once ChatGPT dropped and these guys were able to try and sort of compress their workflows, they...

I realized that, look, the entire game's up, and it's not a question of, like, whether the technology will be able to do this autonomously all the way on its own, but rather, how are you going to sort of process re-engineer the sort of issues from the get-go?

At that time, I think Roy from Peak was basically also just in his own world, and he kind of approached you and Akash, and they were having lunch, and they're like, what would you think about it if it was to build IT services 2.0 from the ground up using AI as your differentiator?

And this was before any of the really cool things was possible. So that's where it started off, and I think where we are at the moment, specifically with where the public markets are going and where the public markets are thinking, I mean, the question is pretty much very simple, right?

Do you believe IT services are going to get disrupted? If yes, get the counter-hedge to that. If no, then you have the greatest buying opportunity in the world.

Put your money where your mouth is, and let's just go, like, you have some great stocks to buy.

[@16:00](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=960.002) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Effective at 5 seats or 10 seats but your 20,000 seat pricing just makes no sense anymore. And second, because you are building a central shared asset, you have this inordinate complexity like I have a customer right now who really does not require the kind of complexity they have in their SaaS.

And they're like whatever, some million dollar rev. I mean, every little feature has 50 conflict flags, which is normal if you're going to build out a one-size-fits-all, But now, given the way that the execution is shifting, it is now very cheap to do tailor-made build-outs, right?

So now suddenly, the way we are seeing it is that software is becoming a low-margin business. There's no two ways about it.

It's going to converge into a low-margin business. And it's going to convert into a low-margin business on top of these rails, right?

Where now, you as a provider of software, cannot keep the margin for yourself. You're going to use AI to deliver enormous alpha, but you're going to split that alpha with your customer continuously.

There's no alternative to this. And we believe that what this is going to do is now this eliminates the distinction between a SaaS company and a services company.

What I mean by this is, for example, like, let's say that you have a mature portfolio company, you know, whatever, Series B, Series C, Series D, SaaS company, their software asset mode has evaporated.

What they retain is a brand mode, distribution mode. And if there is specialized domain knowledge, the specialized domain knowledge mode.

[@17:24](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1044.02) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

There is some level of context and integration mode also. Like, I think especially like thinking about like, I mean, I'm thinking of like companies I've invested in and somewhat close to are sitting on top of ERPs.

And, you know, AI can do a lot of things, but it still cannot integrate into SAP. And that is like a six to 12 month process.

And there's like those integrations that are like modes in a way. I'm not saying that it will stay forever.

But at least as of today, I don't know what cloud raises today. And maybe that disappears. But as of today, those integrations and that context to an extent is a mode.

[@17:58](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1078.46) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Yes, absolutely. Now, the question now becomes, you've got revenue, you've got a position. Now, whether you're a services company or a SaaS company, your real defensibility there is that context, that knowledge, and your contracts.

Yeah. Right? How do you defend this revenue? Because otherwise, today, CSA companies are going to come and eat your lunch.

[@18:17](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1097.94) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Yeah.

[@18:19](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1099.2) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Right? And in many ways, this is now partially a software delivery problem, which is like, okay, we'll build your software for you.

[@18:26](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1106.42) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

That's option A. Yeah.

[@18:27](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1107.7) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Option B, we'll help you transform into a much more efficient, lower margin, but higher revenue business.

[@18:33](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1113.88) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

The services company itself, not the client.

[@18:36](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1116.88) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

No, I'm saying that, yeah, I mean, I'm saying whether you're a services company or a SaaS company, you have to execute this transition.

[@18:43](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1123.12) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Yes, that I agree.

[@18:44](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1124.92) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

These two are now starting to converge, whereas services company is going to start building very quick, cheap software assets.

And the SaaS company now has to build a services division to start building cheap assets because their large asset is no longer valuable.

[@18:58](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1138.34) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Agreed.

[@18:58](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1138.88) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

So these two start to converge. So in both cases, there is a transformation problem. For the SaaS company, the question now becomes, and I'm not talking about like big tech SaaS here, right?

Like a seriously heavy-hitting CTO will do this for themselves. I'm not talking about that segment, right? I'm talking about the segment where either you're a scaled up, but you're a business tech company.

And one of my seven-figure customers is like this today. There's nobody in decision making. The CEO is a banker, the CIO is a chartered accountant, right?

And this is a very common pattern. These types of companies now will have to start outsourcing their tech in order to be able to execute this transition.

Because what they're saying now is, I'm a sales organization. I differentiate on my ability to sell based on my context.

The software is not a motor, you outsource it, someone else built it. Or you're a services company and you're saying that, look, I now need to be able to start building these cheap, fast software assets.

And that's a whole new process. It's a whole new talent pool. It's a whole new operator. I need to transform into this.

Now we are in a position to attack both these sectors.

[@19:53](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1193.62) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Right.

[@19:55](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1195.26) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

For the SaaS companies, we are in a services company. For the SaaS This is a company. We are a transformation company and potentially even a product and platform company.

[@20:07](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1207.42) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Right. And interesting because like I've seen...

[@20:11](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1211.92) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

So this is where we're seeing things in a nutshell today.

[@20:13](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1213.92) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

This is what's picked out on the ground for us. Got it. Got it. But aren't those like fundamentally two different companies, Sidhu, because I'll tell you like, because maybe and maybe you guys have cracked it, right?

Most companies I'm seeing are either saying you are a SaaS company. I don't know name names, but well, name names.

So let's take like high radius, right? You know, the nice company, they have good revenue, but like fundamentally outside of the context they have on financial data, you know, that whole platform like has to be completely remade, right?

So then you have companies that basically go and say, I'm going to help you agentify your platform and, you know, this is my platform.

This is my operating system for AI agents and I'll put FDs, which is, you know, that's one. Space I'm seeing.

And then there is the other space I'm seeing which is you have these horizontal AI companies which go to services companies and they basically say, we are going to help you sell through our product along with your services offering and our product will be, you know, the AI offering that you can offer to your people while you figure out your AI situation.

How are planning to do both at the same time or how are you like seeing success in both at the same time?

[@21:30](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1290.36) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

No, the interesting thing, Kaushik, is if you look at it, right, those two things are no longer different things.

That's why I'm saying that it starts to converge. So I tell you the distinction, right? The SaaS company is telling me that, look, I do not have the wherewithal today to float a million dollar CTO who's going to run this program and give me like a kick-, agile, fast-moving team.

The metas and the Google will do this, like I can't. Their lock, stock and barrel, you outsource your CIO's organization to me.

It is my problem. So look, for example, let me talk about our operational problem. Okay. Nuts and bolts operational problem in services.

The living manager needs to know who's on leave next week. On a daily basis. Because they're planning day to day, right?

[@23:12](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1392.02) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

They will have a daily cadence where they're reviewing.

[@23:13](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1393.8) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

They're like, okay, who's on leave next week? Who's working on what tickets? Who did what? Why is this ticket stuck?

Which tickets are stuck? We're introducing a new process that says that all tickets now must have an estimate. Whose tickets don't have estimates?

Whom do I flag? There is an operating process software in ERP, if you will, which until today could not be tailor-made to the problem.

It was not cost effective. But today, I have a series of knowledge-based prompts that lay out how we have built a system for ourselves conceptually.

Right? Now using this knowledge base, I can blitz run and rebuild the same system tailor-made for any customer in a week.

Assuming they have reasonably trivial integrations as long as you're integrating with a Jira, you're integrating with all the standards.

Stuff where my integrations now take half an hour to an hour, you're not doing an SAP integration, for example, but you're doing Salesforce, you're doing all your system of record integrations.

I will now give you an operating system layer, an ERP, which gives you perfect visibility, is now building up your context graph.

Like Steve now is running analyses on our projects without talking to any intermediate layers and going down to the unit economic level.

He can drill down in a way, that was impossible before. This is what we offer, but it's not a traditional product in the sense that we're not saying we're licensing your software.

We have the patterns, we know what to build, and we know how to run the process re-engineering to drive numbers on top.

[@24:37](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1477.1) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Yeah. Do you think that, do you think you could show me one of those, if it's like... Yeah, of course.

[@24:45](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1485.32) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Absolutely.

[@24:48](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1488.56) \- **stevensule**

So good. So just while Sidu's loading this up, right? Yeah. To give a little bit more flavor as to like, why we think that it's not just a coding problem or not an...

Engineering problem, and it has to be sort of horizontally extracted across the entire value chain of whatever it is that that company does, starting from like legal, going all the way to delivery, to all of those things.

**SCREEN SHARING: Sidu started screen sharing \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1500.484001)**

The whole point is that it needs to run through a particular system and it needs to be process re-engineered like you are building a car on an assembly line effectively, right?

So that everything moves in sync. Otherwise, you can move engineering by 10x, but then you get bought by somewhere else.

[@25:27](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1527.46) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Right.

[@25:29](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1529.38) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Yeah. Sorry, can you guys see my screen?

[@25:31](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1531.74) \- **stevensule**

Yeah.

[@25:32](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1532.08) \- **Vinay Mimani**

Yeah.

[@25:32](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1532.72) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Yeah. So this is the core ERP which is running our services operations internally, right? 100% bi-coded, six months old, six, eight months old now.

[@25:42](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1542.14) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Eight months of data in this.

[@25:43](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1543.76) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Nice. Right? This is the core report. This is the daily stand-up. This is what the delivery manager runs every single day.

And over time, and this changes every day now, but it keeps a focus on what are the decisions the manager needs to make operationally to run the meeting efficiently.

And And highlight process re-engineering changes which require attention. For example, as I mentioned, banal stuff like Leaves. We lower friction on this on all points.

So sorry, let me just pull up my Slack. I mean, you've seen this before, but I'm just closing the loop for you.

[@26:15](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1575.72) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

It's not a big deal.

[@26:16](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1576.56) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Historically, people just drop in on the Leaves channel on Slack and say something, right? Now we have a Claude agent and everyone just tags the agent.

Nice. And so now you can take four hours of leave. can give whatever, right?

[@26:31](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1591.7) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

And so this is basically going to be like the main system of record here is your own ERP. This one, not like Workday or something.

[@26:41](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1601.78) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

No, this is the fun part. We are not going around with existing systems of record. There's very little alpha today in doing that.

So my ticketing system is sitting on ClickUp or Jira.

[@26:49](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1609.76) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

It doesn't matter.

[@26:50](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1610.74) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Right? My meetings are being run through Fathom. Right? I just built a center. My ERP now is basically a data lake with a bunch of integrations.

[@26:58](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1618.58) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

That's it. So

[@27:00](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1620.0) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

But this leave is getting logged in a workday or is this leave just sitting here? So we don't have a HRMS.

we just built a No, no, of course. we had a HRMS, would be in time.

[@27:09](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1629.64) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Okay, okay. Nice. This is pretty cool.

[@27:12](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1632.1) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

So now I know who have blue hours. I know. So for example, there are people without tickets. No work should be done without tickets.

We are now running an analytics layer on top of agent usage by individuals to flag issues. So right now we have a drive on commit quality.

So now it's flagged that these people have commit quality issues, the manager can drill down. Nice. Then the individual.

I know that as of right now, Isaac has spent 67% of his time on the NUS project, 25% of his time on meetings, 8% on NUS contract generation, and has built 6 hours as of right this moment.

[@27:47](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1667.76) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Right.

[@27:48](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1668.68) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Within this, can also tell you that the first ticket he's picked up is a well-specced ticket, but these tickets are .

[@27:56](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1676.58) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

This is pretty cool because this is, this is like, I'm sure you've seen. you've school this Zip HQ, right?

[@28:02](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1682.04) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

I have not, no.

[@28:03](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1683.62) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

So Zip is, used to be, pre-AI, used to be the fastest growing SaaS company. think it was the fastest to hit 200, fastest to hit 300, and so on.

And this is pre-AI, I'm just like, not the best analogy, but like, Zip basically succeeded because it said all your systems of record are .

I'm just going to build a better system of record for procurement, and I'm just going to orchestrate across multiple systems of record.

And procurement teams liked it so much that, you know, then the rest is history, I guess.

[@28:32](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1712.36) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

They crawled upwards from there, I'm sure now it's agentic or whatever, but yeah.

[@28:36](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1716.1) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Of course. Yeah.

[@28:38](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1718.06) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

See, this is the last piece I'll show you, this generally repeats, but here, this is now a view into the activities performed so far.

Right. So, excluding meetings is 4.8 hours of work done. Right. And we have a 51% confidence on the accuracy of this.

[@28:51](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1731.08) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Nice, okay.

[@28:52](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1732.02) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

And this is based on the fact that 26 commits have happened, 7 commits have posted.

[@28:55](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1735.86) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Yeah.

[@28:56](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1736.26) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

But concerningly, zero skills were invoked, which is a smell.

[@28:59](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1739.28) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Yeah.

[@29:00](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1740.0) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

And we have an isolated environment, which we call EXO, which is basically our, you know, ISO, all the compliance capable runtime, and we run all our AI tools within that.

[@29:11](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1751.96) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Right.

[@29:13](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1753.12) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Right, so whether it's Cloud Code, Codex, whatever, you have your customer satisfied that it's secure. However, this is very concerning because if he's done all this work, why are they zero EXO sessions?

So most likely this is because he's working on his personal Cloud Code. Right, so if he was working on a bank or something, yeah, he's working on NUS, but he was working on a banking client or something, you would see EXO sessions here because you have to operate in a secure environment.

[@29:35](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1775.12) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Got it, got it.

[@29:36](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1776.32) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

All his, all his tickets are estimated, no problem. All his comment quality is good. And he has one ticket clocked.

Now this can be evolved daily.

[@29:44](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1784.8) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

It is evolved daily.

[@29:46](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1786.58) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Right. So we are no longer talking about, sorry, let me just unshare this. We are no longer talking about customizing some generic SaaS to the person.

We are saying day to day we are customizing and this is the model. We're about all our deliveries. It is next day delivery.

Come in the morning, ask for something, it's in production next day.

[@30:04](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1804.72) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Yeah.

[@30:06](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1806.04) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Right? So I think that from a service perspective, two things have happened in software which were impossible pre-AI from a service perspective.

And I'm including product companies where I'm saying that you have an internal software team serving a business team, right?

[@30:18](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1818.7) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Yes.

[@30:19](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1819.1) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

In 20 years, I have never seen a delighted customer. Yeah. Satisfied? Maybe. But genuinely dopamine hit excited?

[@30:27](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1827.22) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

No. Yeah.

[@30:28](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1828.92) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

On NUS, for the first time, we saw that. Because NUS is the first project and all of this was unlocks on top of 4-5, where we literally went and hit that dopamine thing every morning.

[@30:40](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1840.64) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Nice.

[@30:41](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1841.36) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Okay? And that lady was so happy. She was all smiles. POC done, she got bogged down in procurement because NUS procurement is, you know, how it goes with it.

We went to them after three business days. She came back, she's like, they're going to take time. have $50,000 of discretionary spent.

[@30:56](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1856.5) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

I'm unlocking it and signing it. Just sign another POC with me.

[@31:00](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1860.0) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Put module 1 into the POC, call it a POC, I need to get moving.

[@31:03](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1863.84) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Nice.

[@31:04](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1864.9) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

So we are now able to deliver customer delight. Second thing which is differentiated, which I'm seeing for the first time, is we are now delivering a consumer-grade experience.

Because I don't have to put five designers to build a basically decent-looking app with good quality, right? And then if the customer warrants it, then I'll staff a designer on it and then elevate it beyond that.

But my table stakes on design is no longer enterprise crap. I'm able to give consumer-grade experience in an enterprise context.

So I think these two things are massive differentiators. These are Delta 4, right?

[@31:34](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1894.58) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Our customer experiences, they're not going to go to another vendor.

[@31:37](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1897.9) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

So this, I believe, is the interesting pivot of the whole model. Everything pivots on this. I'm predicting that in two years, same-day and next-day delivery are table stakes in IT.

[@31:47](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1907.52) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

If you cannot offer same-day and next-day options to your customers, you are in GMI. Yeah. Super cool. And do you want to tell me a little bit about, like, how you go to...

Market today, how you do the scoping and yeah.

[@32:04](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1924.46) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Yeah, Steve, you want to?

[@32:06](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1926.56) \- **stevensule**

So you started off the conversation by asking us like when we were thinking about, when we started this off, it was on Salesforce focus, right?

Because we need a standardized platform and we needed something which had a large distribution node. Originally, when we started off, we wanted to just focus on that Salesforce environment and we thought over time as the technology gets better, we'll move into ServiceNow, Workday and so on.

So platform by platform, right? It was going to be attacking that platform by platform. What's happened since 4.5 has dropped is effectively now everything's open.

You can be looking on any platform at any time and because the alpha is so great that you can actually deliver the same kind of quality of service across the board.

So we have two motions running because we have heavily invested in the Salesforce ecosystem. We run that traditional motion which Vinay can walk you through, which is basically becoming a system, an SI for Salesforce.

So any Salesforce project that comes in, we are reliant upon the.

[@32:59](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1979.84) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Reliant There's a mature standard motion over there that is run by sales.

[@33:03](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1983.92) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Got it.

[@33:05](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=1985.26) \- **stevensule**

So our go-to market is actually through Salesforce and their AEs, right? They get a particular company that they want to pitch their licensing revenue to, blah, blah, blah.

We become the integrator for them and so on and so forth. Now that has its own challenges simply because longevity is what determines whether or not you get projects or not.

How long you've been in the system. Us being early, sort of late, come out to the system, we tend to get either deals that are in the red.

So we have to salvage them for them, which for us is a good differentiator for us because we end up salvaging them.

Or it's with the agent force pivot, right? Because everyone started afresh with agent force. On the non-Salesforce side, we predominantly run a consulting-led GTM, right?

Which is to say that we identify a particular pain point with a customer. We build out a very fast-moving POC for them where that alleviates that particular pain point.

And then we go horizontally across workflow by workflow.

[@33:59](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2039.22) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

I'm going to nuance that. What we are realizing is that, unlike every other time that I have sold services before this, I am no longer offering an incremental delta.

The difference in the experience of the customer is massive. My problem is, I do not have the easy land because the market is saturated with snake oil salesmen.

So both in NUS and Podroom now, our land was the challenge, but once we are in, within two to three weeks, the customer is floating new SOWs to us.

So what has happened now is my expand in an account is completely value-driven because the customer can see that for every dollar they spend with us, are getting $3-$4 back.

[@34:39](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2079.3) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

can literally see it. But our challenge is the land because we cannot easily stand out in the AI noise.

[@34:45](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2085.74) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

So now we are trying to figure out what is the sharp point at which we land. Because what we are also noticing is one of our US customers and our Australian customers are both private equity players.

Both on the clock.

[@34:58](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2098.14) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Yeah.

[@34:58](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2098.84) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Right? Because they are in that... So cycle where it is reaching the point where they need to be able to flip, but the asset is not ready.

And the asset is not fundamentally due to blockers in the CIO's office. Everyone from the CEO to the partner on the private equity side is aligned that the bottleneck is the CIO's organization.

We are starting to see this sharpen as a potential ICP. This segment is still early for us, I'm caveating, right?

So this is not like a mature GTM. But the thesis that we are seeing over here is, there is a company with strong revenue, strong history.

It is now at existential risk because the CIO's organization is failing to deliver fast enough.

[@35:38](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2138.71) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Right.

[@35:39](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2139.71) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

And we step in and we become the CIO's organization, but we don't go big bang.

[@35:45](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2145.07) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

We don't try to negotiate a million dollar contract upfront.

[@35:48](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2148.03) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

The point is to do a hit and run POC and deliver the value with such high delta that after that your expand is on value.

You're not, you're you're no longer selling, right? They are coming to you with work because they see the value.

So this is what I believe is going to be the motion on this. We've got two examples of this now, and we need to sort of, I'm here early, so I can't commit that there is a maturity cycle, but the latest contract we signed is with an explicit agenda where the CEO is like, listen, I need a 12 month commitment from you.

I only have line of sight to April, but I'm booking you all the way to December. Because I will know what next I'm going to churn out, but I'm very clear that I'm replacing this entire organization, and I need you committed to take everything over.

Right? So that in that one account, we've already closed a million dollar SOW, and the total TAM over there, as we crawl up and accrue more, caps out at about 3 million, and their current burn is 5\.

So this is the CEO's logic, right? She's like, I'm spending 5 bucks a year now, can you deliver better than this, faster than this, for 3 bucks?

The answer is yes, we can.

[@36:58](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2218.75) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

How are you like, kind of...

[@38:00](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2280.01) \- **stevensule**

So that's one area of how we're sourcing it. The second area is that just from our own network, people that have become advisors or become sort of strategic sort of role, like not role models, but strategic kind of guidance counselors for like technology and whatnot, we end up doing a lot of work for them or through them, right?

So again, guys that are like advising boards on how to AI transform and whatnot. So that becomes another very logical point of view for us to get into.

[@38:30](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2310.15) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Got it. I think on the EQT side of things, obviously, I think there's a lot of, I think there's a lot of companies that fit that archetype, right?

I think Jeff, I'll speak to Jeff, but like, we can definitely help with connecting.

[@38:46](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2326.43) \- **stevensule**

Vinay, we've done some background work on this for, we had done some background work for this call as to like where we think, which companies we've rated them according to, we've gone through all of your 270 portfolio companies and figured out which ones we think would be the

Best fit for us to be able to come in and sort of play that role. We can walk you through that if there's time.

But ultimately, think that, look, I think these two motions are running sort of parallelly at the moment. We believe they will converge into one.

There are those customers that are Salesforce heavy that have all this other stuff, which is not on Salesforce, but will want transformation as well.

**ACTION ITEM: Email Kaushik: top 5–10 EQT services prospects \+ priming signals; then Kaushik intro to 1–2 \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2354.9999)**

**ACTION ITEM: Email Jeff: sync on Realfast \+ portfolio intros \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2354.9999)**

And we feel that we can work up the value chain there. And then for everybody else who's not on Salesforce, the world's your oyster, effectively.

[@39:25](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2365.93) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Yeah, I think, send me that, send us that list. Jeff would be the best person because he's much closer to the PE side of the house than I am.

But I'll speak to him and we can, we can kind of get to work and at least connect you to a couple of, couple of firms there.

Is your focus more on Asia or generally globally?

[@39:44](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2384.69) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

We are open to develop markets. We don't do developing markets right now. Though, of course, that's deal velocity constraint, right?

If there's a fast deal in developing markets, sure. Right now, We're operating in the US, Dubai. We have one customer in Dubai.

[@40:03](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2403.53) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Got it. Got it.

[@40:04](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2404.95) \- **stevensule**

Again, the context with the developing market, like call it out, like in the Indian market, man, nobody wants to pay and definitely nobody wants to pay for consulting-led GTM, right?

They like run six months discovery for free.

[@40:16](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2416.09) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

And I should qualify, like this is, this is, this is the story Steve is telling is, is, is a company where the executive director is his childhood buddy.

We've got a mandate from the executive director right at the top to do this and still nothing moves.

[@40:30](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2430.01) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Yeah, yeah. I think, I mean, I know there are people who are very optimistic about selling software into India.

I am not. I think it's good. It's a good place to make software. It's not a great place to sell software.

So, I think that makes a ton of sense. But I think we have a number of like American Indian services companies.

[@40:46](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2446.47) \- **stevensule**

I think that could be quite interesting.

[@40:47](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2447.85) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

I think we can, we can definitely talk to, we can definitely talk to those. Where are at in terms of number of customers and revenue today?

I know like ACV is probably going to be a not the right metric to look at this company, but

[@42:00](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2520.01) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

We believe the channel over there has to be PE. That's the most aligned channel for everyone. All stakeholders are aligned.

The question we have is how do we generate proof points for PE without getting into complex transactions? Can we generate a proof point that we can transform a company without going through the complexity of buying the company first?

Because once you have that proof point, then we go balls deep on this, right? Then we're talking about looking at much bigger things and just going crazy on that.

So the real objective over here is not so much to generate revenue, though, of course, that's important to us.

It is to generate proof points for PE in the fastest possible way. So that in three months, we have conviction that, look, this is possible, this model works, it has these advantages, it has these limitations, we know, now let's go crazy.

[@42:40](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2560.37) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Yeah, I mean, there's also this, do you know Percepta?

[@42:44](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2564.85) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Not familiar, no.

[@42:46](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2566.63) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

So GC is basically, you should look it up, Percepta.ai.

[@42:50](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2570.93) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Right. GC is basically started their own services company. Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, And I think they've done the first move with the

Anand had started something, spun out from them 2-3 years ago and this is the second, right? Or is the same one, rebranded?

[@43:06](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2586.19) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

No, no, this is different. don't think this is, yeah, yeah, this is, I think Anand went to Fivetran, right, if I'm not wrong.

[@43:13](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2593.71) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

No.

[@43:14](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2594.99) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

I don't know exactly what their plan is, but basically Percepta is a services company that does AI transformation for old school companies.

So my guess is that they will buy old school companies and use Percepta as a company to transform them.

Yeah, logical.

[@43:29](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2609.75) \- **stevensule**

I mean, 8090 is also doing something similar, right? They're calling themselves the software factory to be able to go into enterprises and basically do the same thing.

I think there are a bunch of companies that are trying to do this. Our point of view is that, look, ultimately, it's the relationship that you actually have to acquire because these are deeply embedded.

So if you're going to go absolutely left-wing, right, just flip the model of what is traditional consulting on its head because now you've got a combination of consulting and delivery.

Embedded into one. So if you take a McKinsey partner who is doing a bunch of consulting gigs where he has the relationship in his pocket, right?

He ultimately takes whatever revenue he generates out of that and puts into a centralized pot and then he gets a certain cut out of that, right?

Here you're saying that you're giving them the delivery capacity. You own the relationship. Is there a way to change the economics of that where you keep the bunch of the revenue for yourself, right?

[@44:27](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2667.09) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Like, I mean, ultimately, you're changing that narrative around because you have delivery on demand effectively for that guy that owns the relationship with the customer.

Yeah. Very fair. In terms of tangible next steps, so outside of the company intros, what would be helpful? I think in terms of investing, it'll be a bit early for us right now in terms of what we're looking at, obviously, I think given the stage.

But I think, yeah, I think, you know, keen to kind of build up the relationship because there's a lot, there's a lot that we could do together.

[@45:00](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2700.01) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Absolutely. I think that actually very specifically my focus is to outline what is it that you folks are looking for in terms of signals of proof points.

Because for us, all of this is gunning towards a Series A where the Series A then allows us to go do a large acquisition.

[@45:14](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2714.73) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Yeah.

[@45:15](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2715.25) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

What are the proof points you guys are looking for? And let's figure out the fastest way to deliver those proof points.

[@45:19](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2719.83) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Proof points to invest, you mean?

[@45:21](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2721.51) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Or proof points for... Yeah, absolutely.

[@45:24](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2724.89) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

I mean, it's basically, look, I think specifically on the Asia side and for like what you guys are building, I think it will just be working with our portfolio companies and the portfolio company CIO coming and saying, boss, this changed my life.

Yeah. Right, like I think it's really just that. I think our value prop is kind of the opposite of a Silicon Valley VC.

Like we can't get you dinner with Sam Altman, but I can get you dinner with the CEO of Siemens anytime you want, right?

So I think because we have that kind of industrial background and we have those connections and things like that.

So... So for us, we rely heavily on what are the proof points that come out from companies that are using it.

And more often than not, there's either a Wallenberg family company or there's an EQT portfolio company that's using most of the companies that we invest in.

[@46:16](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2776.43) \- **stevensule**

I mean, if I looked at the ranking of like PE funds that exist, and in terms of exposure to SaaS and whatnot, you guys are on the lower end of the thing, right?

Which means that your portfolio is actually old school, real businesses that are going through this transition phase. And for us, like, the point of this call was exactly that, right?

Let's see where we can work, put us on a timeline, put us on a clock, and let us be able to deliver that value for a particular company and then just move on.

**ACTION ITEM: Research Percepta.ai; update Sidu/Steve/Vinay on fit \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2795.9999)**

[@46:43](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2803.71) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Yeah, yeah. I think that would be cool. I think there's, I think the Perceptor thing is also quite interesting.

I think we're trying to do something like that. Let me find out more details and then come back to you because maybe there's a way to kind of get you guys plugged into that as well.

[@46:57](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2817.93) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

That would be awesome.

[@46:59](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2819.59) \- **Vinay Mimani**

Thank you. One question, when we share the list of prospects with you, are there specific geographies that we should prioritize given because Jeff operates in Hong Kong, should we fill certain countries?

[@47:09](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2829.39) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

I would start with the services companies because I think you have to think about like where the pain point is most dire.

I think let's say you took a company like, let me take three companies in the portfolio, right? So, one is United Talent Agency, which is a Hollywood Talent Agency.

One is Credila, which is a loan company in India. And the other one is Perficient, which is a consulting company, like whatever, services company.

I would think that Perficient is more acute pain point than Credila. And Credila is more acute than United Talent Agency.

So I would kind of like, I would calibrate that way. And I would keep it more focused than like the whole long list.

Just keep it focused to like five or 10\. We can try those if that works out great.

[@48:00](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2880.01) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

If doesn't work out, we can go for the next step.

[@48:02](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2882.67) \- **Vinay Mimani**

understand.

[@48:03](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2883.35) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

What we'll also include is the kind of signals that we see that prime a company for this kind of a change.

[@48:10](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2890.35) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Yeah.

[@48:11](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2891.39) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Because otherwise you have other layers of challenges within the hierarchy. If you want to see the impact quickly, just pick the aligned company.

We'll give you those signals as well.

[@48:20](https://fathom.video/calls/578381407?timestamp=2900.71) \- **Kaushik Subramanian (EQT Ventures)**

Sounds great.
