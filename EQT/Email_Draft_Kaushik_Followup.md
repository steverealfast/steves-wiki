Kaushik,

Great speaking with you yesterday. Appreciate the time and the directness — particularly the steer on focusing where pain is most acute.

As promised, we've gone through the full EQT portfolio (270+ companies) and scored them across four dimensions: operational complexity, AI maturity, hiring signals, and process intensity. Rather than sending a long list, we've kept it to nine — each with a specific thesis on where we'd compete and what we'd move.

The shortlist:

| Company | Region | Why |
|---------|--------|-----|
| SSP Group | UK | 2,000 F&B units across 600+ locations, 40 countries. 343 people in finance ops. Supplier coordination, location P&L, staffing allocation — all high-volume, repetitive back-office across dispersed sites. |
| IVC Evidensia | UK | 2,500 vet clinics, 20 countries, 41K employees. Each clinic semi-independent. Dispersed billing, scheduling, supply chain. Classic franchise-model operational friction. |
| Magnit Global | US | Contingent workforce management in 160 countries. 340 finance headcount. Supplier coordination, program ops, compliance — rules-heavy, process-intensive. |
| VFS Global | UAE | 100K+ visa applications processed daily for 69 governments. 249 finance headcount. High-volume, rules-based document processing and scheduling at massive scale. |
| WS Audiology | SG | Hearing aid manufacturing, €2.63B revenue, 125 countries. 287 finance headcount. Procurement, reconciliation, supply chain across geographies. |
| Nord Anglia Education | UK | 89 international schools, 37 countries. 176 finance headcount. Multi-country HR, finance, facilities management at scale. |
| First Student | US | Largest school bus operator in North America. 50K employees, 500+ locations. Dispatch, driver management, contract admin. |
| Solera | US | Global leader in vehicle lifecycle management SaaS. 319 finance headcount. Serves 300,000+ customers in 100+ countries. Claims, fleet, and dealer operations — high-volume transaction processing across a fragmented customer base. |
| Storable | US | Leading self-storage management software. 40 finance headcount. Trusted by 30,000+ facilities. Payments, facility management, and tenant operations — operationally intensive despite being software-led. |

Each of these companies has complex, multi-site operations with hundreds of people in back-office functions. At this scale, they are almost certainly spending millions annually on IT services firms for system integration, process automation, and operational tooling. The question we'd help you pressure-test: are they getting value for that spend?

On Perficient — you flagged them as having the most acute pain, and we agree. But as a services company, the typical engagement cycle is arduous. Longer deal cycles don't align with demonstrating quick proof of value. Our recommendation is to start with the companies above — where we can deliver a measurable result in 4-6 weeks — and use that proof point to inform the services company conversation later.

We've also attached a sample scoring for a few of these companies to give you context on how we evaluate transformation readiness. We look at four dimensions: operational complexity, AI maturity (inverse — lower internal AI capability means higher need for an external partner), hiring signals (active recruitment in Finance/Ops/IT indicates budget and appetite), and process intensity. Should give you and Jeff a sense of how we think about prioritisation.

The ask remains the same: pick one of these companies. Give us one workflow — G&A, RevOps, support — and one business metric. We'll diagnose where friction actually exists and deliver a measurable delta in 4-6 weeks. If we don't move the metric, we don't invoice.

Jeff — we're CC'ing you here as Kaushik mentioned you'd be the right person on the PE side. Happy to walk through the analysis in more detail at your convenience. The US and Asia-Pac companies on this list (Magnit, First Student, Solera, Storable, WS Audiology, VFS Global) may be closest to your portfolio.

Looking forward to the next step.

Steve

*INTERNAL NOTES (do not include in email):*

- Keep Percepta.ai out of this email. Kaushik said he'd come back to us on that — let him drive it.
- Jeff needs a separate, shorter email if this one doesn't get a response within a week.
- Priming signals (EQT_Company_Scoring.md) attached with this email. Currently covers VFS Global, IVC Evidensia, Nord Anglia, WS Audiology, Magnit. SSP, First Student, Solera, and Storable not yet scored in the framework — consider adding before sending.
- If Kaushik responds with a specific company, move immediately. Have the scoping framework ready.
