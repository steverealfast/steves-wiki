## The Context

Software and IT services public markets are repricing. The BVP Emerging Cloud Index is down 30% over twelve months. Indian IT services stocks shed over $12B in market cap in a single day this week on AI disruption fears. SaaS multiples have compressed from 25-40x EV/EBITDA at peak to 15-18x. Our view: the unit economics underneath have not structurally changed. Until they do, we do not expect multiples to recover.

The structural forces are not new. Revenue per employee across IT services has been flat for a decade. Deal sizes are compressing. Two dynamics make this urgent. First, buying AI tools does not solve the problem — it accelerates one stage of a multi-stage pipeline while everything upstream and downstream stays manual. The bottleneck relocates. The firm does not get faster. Second, bench capacity is under sustained downward pressure. The buffer that historically absorbed project overruns and delivery slippage is gone. Every engagement now has to land close to its time-to-value target with fewer spare resources to deploy when things slip.

The metric that governs whether a firm survives this is what we call friction per unit of revenue — the total cost to move one dollar from first customer conversation to delivered outcome. That number needs to come down. Across the industry, it has not moved — and traditionally, it has never had to. IT services firms are structurally built around large, multi-year contracts where value delivery is heavily back-loaded. In a recent conversation with a major US consulting firm, we were told that in a typical managed services engagement, it takes their team two to three years to come up to speed with requirements gathering and triaging before real value is passed on to the customer. That is not an efficiency problem. That is a structural limitation baked into the operating model. The firms that break out will be the ones that fundamentally reduce friction per unit of revenue — not through headcount cuts, but by restructuring how work flows through the entire organization.

## What realfast Has Built

This is the industrialisation of the software services industry. The analogy is precise: before the assembly line, making individual craftsmen faster — better tools, better training — did not transform the economics of manufacturing. What changed everything was restructuring how work flowed through the entire production process. The resistance to that shift was identical to what we see today. In private equity terms: think of inventory turns of people. The assembly line did not eliminate craftsmen. It changed how many units of output each craftsman produced per unit of time. That is the transformation we are executing.

The pattern is not limited to IT services firms. It is playing out across every industry. Enterprises in healthcare, financial services, industrials, and professional services are all buying AI tools and seeing the same result: one stage of the pipeline gets faster, the rest stays manual. The bottleneck moves. The organization does not get faster. There are three ways a company deploys AI: AI in the product it sells, AI for building the product, and AI to run the company. The industry is fixated on the first two. The third is where the structural economics change — and it is the one almost nobody has built. Giving engineers Copilot is the equivalent of giving craftsmen better hammers. It helps the individual. It does not change the economics of the firm.

realfast is the IT services firm that solved this problem for itself first — and now delivers that capability to others. AI is not a tool our people use. It is the infrastructure the business runs on. Every function — pre-sales, delivery, operations, recruitment — operates through Exocortex, an AI operating system that spans the full pipeline from first conversation to delivered outcome.

Exocortex does three things:
- **Extracts** institutional knowledge from people, contracts, past projects, and domain expertise
- **Maintains** that knowledge as the business evolves
- **Applies** it across workflows — whoever needs it, whenever they need it

This produces structural cost elimination, not marginal efficiency gains. A consultant who previously needed two developers to deliver now delivers alone. No timezone coordination. No role dependencies. No handoff overhead. That is not a 10% improvement. It is a 2-3x margin shift on every engagement it touches.

But the part that should change how you think about this is the compounding effect. Every project realfast completes makes the next one faster. Domain knowledge does not walk out the door when the project team disbands. It stays in the system. Patterns, edge cases, client-specific context — all of it accumulates. A competitor who starts building this today is not just behind on technology. They are behind on every engagement we have already run. That gap widens with every project delivered. In investment terms: this is an asset that appreciates with use.

The unit economics implication is direct. realfast can profitably deliver at price points where traditional IT services firms cannot operate. Not because we undercut. Because our friction per unit of revenue is structurally lower. We can serve a $50K engagement and a $1M engagement with the same operating model. Most firms cannot serve anything below their minimum viable deal size without losing money. They do not even know what that number is.

This reframes the operating objective: optimize for deal velocity, not deal size. When friction per unit of revenue is low enough, the size of the deal becomes irrelevant. What matters is how fast deals move through the pipeline — from conversation to delivered outcome to cash collected. The proof is in the margins: a $30K engagement at 70% margin and a $1M engagement at 70% margin, delivered through the same operating model. If the model only works at one price point, it is an optimization. Working across the full range is a structural shift.

Three barriers prevent replication:

1. **The extraction problem.** Tokenizing institutional expertise into a usable system is continuous, deeply technical work. Most firms lack the capability to build this infrastructure — not the tools, the discipline.

2. **The adoption problem.** This requires changing who you hire and how they work. We have lived this internally. Some people refused to use the system. Conviction drives adoption, not training programs. You deliver undeniable results first. Adoption follows.

3. **The compounding problem.** Every engagement adds to the knowledge base. A late entrant is not just behind on technology — they are behind on accumulated domain expertise across every vertical, every client, every project. Time in market is the moat.

## The EQT Portfolio

EQT has adopted AI at the fund level. Motherbrain. A 40-person digital team. Strategic partnerships with the major foundation model providers. An annual AI summit. The mandate is clear and the commitment is real.

The question is: what is happening inside the portfolio?

273 companies. The adoption rate across those companies is a fraction of what it is at the fund. EQT's own published data shows only 20% of their investment professionals generate the bulk of AI usage internally — and that is at EQT itself, with every advantage of proximity, mandate, and tooling. The further you move from the centre of gravity — from fund to portfolio company leadership to operational teams — the lower the adoption drops.

This is not a technology gap. The technology exists. This is an execution gap. The portfolio companies are running on the same unit economics the industry has been stuck on for a decade. They have not restructured how work flows through their organizations. They have purchased tools and announced AI strategies. The underlying friction has not changed.

And even when leadership mandates action — when the executive team asks "what's holding you back?" — the answer is structural. In a recent conversation with a PE-backed technology company, a senior operations leader said it plainly: we do not know where or how to begin. The default response is to hire consultants who charge by the hour and deliver polished strategy decks. Maturity assessments. Roadmaps. Recommendations that require a separate implementation partner to execute. None of it moves a business metric.

realfast starts differently. We do not begin with strategy or assessment. We classify where work breaks down: where it slows because humans are doing unnecessary manual tasks (**automate**), where it slows because humans lack decision support (**augment**), and where it slows because systems and data do not connect (**connect**). Each of these maps directly to friction per unit of revenue — the metric introduced earlier. We pick the narrowest workflow where removing that friction delivers a clear, near-term business outcome, and we move the metric before expanding scope. Proof before scale. Every time.

We are not asking to benchmark against existing investments. We are not asking to integrate with existing programs. We are asking for something simpler:

**Pick one of your portfolio companies that is struggling with the structural problems described above. Give us one project — one workflow, one business metric, one delivery window. We will deliver a measurable delta against however they are currently operating. If we do not deliver, we do not charge.**

We are faster, leaner, and hungrier than anything currently deployed against this problem. The only way to validate that claim is to test it on real work.

## The Ask

We are asking for one engagement at one portfolio company. The ideal starting point:

- A company with visible operational friction — backlogs, manual processing, slow decision cycles
- One workflow with a measurable business metric attached
- A 4-6 week delivery window
- High enough visibility that the results reach fund-level stakeholders

We are not asking to run training programs, conduct AI maturity assessments, or embed in existing workflows as observers. We will own delivery end-to-end. Fixed scope, milestone-based. If the work does not move the metric, we do not invoice.

This is not a pilot. It is a proof event. The proof format is not a case study — it is a timeline. Day-by-day, from first conversation to signed scope to delivered outcome to invoiced payment. That is what demonstrates low friction. Not a deck about what we did. A visible record of how fast we moved.

The cost to EQT of running this test is trivial relative to the portfolio. The information value — seeing whether an AI-native operating model produces structurally different outcomes on real work — is significant.

## What Success Looks Like

Success is not measured by whether the project is delivered. Success is measured by whether the company we work with can go back to working the way they did before.

If we do our job, the delta between what we deliver and what any other vendor can deliver becomes so wide that switching is irrational. Not because of contractual lock-in. Because of performance lock-in. Every engagement deepens Exocortex's understanding of that company's domain, systems, and institutional knowledge. The gap compounds. Six months in, no other vendor can match the speed, cost, or quality — because no other vendor has the accumulated context.

That is the outcome for the portfolio company. The outcome for EQT is larger: a proven AI execution capability that can be deployed across the portfolio as a value creation lever. Not a theory. Not a slide in a fundraising deck. A demonstrated operating model with measured results from inside your own portfolio.

The portfolio-wide expansion is not something we pitch today. It is something that becomes obvious after the first engagement delivers.

There is an additional angle for the Ventures portfolio. Early-stage companies have not yet calcified into traditional operating models. Embedding Exocortex now — before they reach $100M ARR — means the AI infrastructure learns the company as it grows. By the time the company scales, Exocortex has accumulated years of institutional knowledge. The cost of embedding at the early stage is trivial. The cost of retrofitting it later is the same transformation problem every mature firm is struggling with today.
