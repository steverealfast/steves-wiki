# CALL PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT

## What Landed Hard

**Sidu's SaaS-Services Convergence thesis was the star of the call.** The framing that software is becoming a low-margin business, that SaaS companies and services companies are converging, and that the distinction between them is disappearing — Kaushik tracked every step. He was saying "agreed", "yes", "right" at every beat. This was thesis-level alignment, which is exactly what Sidin said Kaushik evaluates on.

**The Manazer demo was the clincher.** Kaushik asked to see it ("could you show me one of those?"), and when Sidu walked through the ERP — leave management, commit quality tracking, individual drill-downs — Kaushik said "this is pretty cool" and compared it to Zip HQ (fastest-growing pre-AI SaaS company). That's a high compliment. He was connecting what he saw to a known winner in his mental model.

**The NUS customer story hit the dopamine point.** Sidu's line about never seeing a "delighted customer" in 20 years of IT, and then seeing it for the first time at NUS — that landed. The detail about the NUS stakeholder unlocking $50K of discretionary spend to keep moving was concrete proof of customer pull.

**Steve's opening candour line worked.** The "do you believe IT services are getting disrupted — if no, it's the buying opportunity of a generation" line was deployed naturally. Kaushik didn't flinch. It set the right frame.

**The PE channel thesis resonated.** Sidu articulating that PE is the most aligned channel — all stakeholders aligned — and that the goal is proof points, not complex transactions. Kaushik engaged directly with this.

## What Could Have Been Sharper

**The portfolio analysis homework wasn't walked through.** Steve mentioned "we've rated your 270 companies" but the actual analysis was never presented. Kaushik didn't get to see the scoring, the filtering, or the specific targets. That was prep that went unused. Vinay asked about geography at the end, but by then Kaushik was already wrapping up.

**Kaushik had to redirect the targeting.** He explicitly said "I would start with the services companies" and named Perficient > Credila > UTA ranked by pain acuteness. The pre-call portfolio analysis (SSP, IVC Evidensia, WS Audiology, etc.) was targeting a different segment.

**Jeff was not on the call.** The entire prep for Jeff (Asia-Pac, Growth angle) was moot. Jeff needs separate outreach.

**The ask could have been crisper.** The call ended with "send us that list" and "we'll connect you to a couple of firms." Good outcome, but the original prep had a tighter ask: "Pick one company, give us one workflow and one metric, 4-6 weeks." That precision wasn't deployed.

# WHAT KAUSHIK ACTUALLY TOLD US

The most important directional signals:

1. **"Start with the services companies."** Target companies where AI disruption is existential, not where G&A headcount is high.
2. **Perficient > Credila > UTA** — ranked by pain acuteness.
3. **"Keep it to 5-10, focused."** Not a long list. Curated, with a thesis for each.
4. **"Portfolio company CIO coming and saying, boss, this changed my life."** This is the proof point that unlocks everything.
5. **"Investing is a bit early for us right now."** Investment is off the table for now. Portfolio company work is the path.
6. **Percepta.ai is interesting to him.** GC started a services company for AI transformation. Kaushik flagged it unprompted.
7. **"Jeff is closer to the PE side of the house."** Jeff is the operational lever. Kaushik is the connector and thesis-validator.

# CRITICAL STRATEGIC REFRAME: PERFICIENT IS A COMPETITOR, NOT A CUSTOMER

Kaushik is gung-ho on Perficient because he sees the acute pain. But we need to be very clear internally about what we do NOT want to become:

**The trap:** EQT introduces us to Perficient. We go in and "help" them with AI transformation. We become a bolt-on tool that makes Perficient's existing model marginally better. They absorb our value, keep their margins, and we're a vendor to them. That's the opposite of disruption.

**Worse:** We teach them our playbook. They learn, replicate, and we've armed the competition.

**The reality:** Perficient is a $2.8B IT services/consulting firm — exactly the kind of company realfast is built to disrupt. The whole thesis — Sidu's convergence argument, the assembly line analogy, the "friction per unit of revenue" metric — is that companies like Perficient are structurally incapable of making this transition themselves. **We don't help them make it. We take their customers.**

## The Correct Framing

Kaushik said Perficient has the most "acute pain." That's true. But the play is to go to **Perficient's customers within EQT's portfolio** and demonstrate that realfast delivers what Perficient charges 5x more and takes 10x longer to do.

**What we actually want from EQT:**
- Portfolio companies that are **currently buying IT services** from firms like Perficient, Cognizant, Wipro, Accenture
- Companies where the CIO is frustrated with their existing SI/consulting relationship
- Companies where EQT (as the PE owner) is asking "why are we spending $5M/year on IT services and getting so little?"

**The pitch to Kaushik/Jeff becomes:**
> "Don't introduce us to Perficient. Introduce us to the companies that are *paying* Perficient. Let us run side by side on one workflow. Same timeline, same metric. Let the results speak."

This is the objection handling line from the call prep — "Run us side by side. Same company, same workflow, same timeline." But now it's the **primary positioning**, not a defensive response.

## Target Companies (Reframed)

The companies from the EQT portfolio that fit this are the ones with **high G&A spend, complex operations, and almost certainly paying traditional SIs already**:

| Company | Region | Finance HC | Why They're Paying SIs |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SSP Group** | UK | 343 | 2,000 units across 30 countries. Massive multi-site ops requiring system integration. |
| **IVC Evidensia** | UK | 308 | 2,500 vet clinics, 20 countries. Dispersed billing, scheduling, supply chain. |
| **WS Audiology** | SG | 287 | Global manufacturing. Procurement, reconciliation, supply chain. |
| **Magnit Global** | US | 340 | Contingent workforce management. Supplier coordination, program ops. |
| **Cast & Crew** | US | 213 | Entertainment payroll across 75 locations. Complex rules-based processing. |
| **Nord Anglia Education** | UK | 176 | 89 schools, 37 countries. Multi-country HR, finance, facilities. |
| **First Student** | US | 170 | 500+ locations. Dispatch, driver management, contract admin. |

These companies are **spending millions on IT services firms right now**. The question for EQT is: are they getting value for that spend? The answer, in almost every case, is no — and we can prove it.

# PERCEPTA.AI INTEL

**What it is:** General Catalyst literally *built* Percepta — it's not a portfolio company, it's GC's own creation. Part of GC's $1.5B "AI-enabled roll-up" strategy where they incubate AI-native companies, then use them to acquire and transform traditional service businesses.

**Who runs it:** Hirsh Jain (ex-Palantir SVP, 7 years), with co-founders from Palantir, MIT, Meta FAIR. Costis Daskalakis (MIT professor, Nevanlinna Prize winner) leads frontier research. 20+ engineers, mostly ex-Palantir.

**Their model:** Embed elite AI engineering teams directly inside Fortune 500 companies and government agencies. Proprietary "Mosaic" platform for orchestrating enterprise AI transformation. Target verticals: healthcare, manufacturing, financial services, government.

**Biggest deal:** Maryland state government partnership with Anthropic and Rockefeller Foundation — AI transformation across multiple state agencies.

**The drama:** Palantir is suing them (filed October 2025) for poaching employees and allegedly stealing playbooks. Lawsuit ongoing.

**How it relates to realfast:** They are **not direct competitors**. Percepta operates at the enterprise buyer level (transform how an entire Fortune 500 uses AI). realfast operates at the IT services delivery level (transform how services get delivered). Different layers of the stack.

**The play:** When Kaushik said "maybe there's a way to get you guys plugged into that" — he's seeing the same parallel. Percepta needs execution partners who can actually deliver transformation at speed. realfast's "same-day/next-day delivery" model is the operational capability Percepta's enterprise clients need. This is a potential **distribution channel**, not a competitive threat.

# FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS

## Priority 1: Email to Kaushik (within 48 hours)

Reframe around the "run us against your current SIs" positioning:
- 5-10 portfolio companies that are currently heavy IT services buyers
- For each: the function where we'd compete, the SI they're likely using, and the metric we'd move
- Include priming signals (indicators a company is ready)
- The ask: "Give us one of these companies. One workflow. Same timeline as their current SI. Let the results speak."

## Priority 2: Email to Jeff (within 48 hours)

Jeff wasn't on the call. He needs:
- Brief summary of what was discussed with Kaushik
- Same curated list with his geography/portfolio flagged
- The ask: intro to 1-2 portfolio company CIOs for a scoped engagement

## Priority 3: Build the "Priming Signals" Framework

Sidu promised this on the call and Kaushik expected it. Document the 5-7 observable signals that indicate a company is ready:
- CIO tenure / recent leadership change in CIO office
- Public statements about AI transformation vs. actual adoption gap
- PE hold period approaching exit window
- Margin compression visible in recent reporting
- Known dissatisfaction with current SI relationships
- Recent failed IT projects or platform migrations
- Board-level AI mandate without execution capability

## Priority 4: Percepta Positioning Memo

Short brief for Sidu on how to engage if Kaushik connects them:
- Frame as partnership (execution layer for Percepta's enterprise clients)
- Understand their vertical focus (healthcare, manufacturing, financial services, government)
- Identify where realfast's speed advantage is most visible against their model

## Priority 5: Perficient Competitive Intelligence

Not to work with them — to compete against them:
- Which EQT portfolio companies is Perficient currently serving?
- What are their typical engagement sizes and timelines?
- Where are they weakest in delivery?
- What would a head-to-head comparison look like on a real workflow?

# THE PROOF POINT PATH

Kaushik told us exactly what he needs: **"portfolio company CIO says this changed my life."**

Work backwards:
1. Which EQT portfolio company gives us the fastest path to that testimonial?
2. What's the specific workflow where we deliver the dopamine hit (like NUS)?
3. What's the 4-6 week timeline to get there?
4. How do we make the result visible to Kaushik without him having to ask?

The cost to EQT of running this test is trivial. The information value — seeing whether an AI-native operating model produces structurally different outcomes on real work — is significant. And if we deliver, Kaushik's 2-paragraph email writes itself.
