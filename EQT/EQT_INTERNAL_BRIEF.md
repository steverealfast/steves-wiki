# EQT: Internal Strategy Brief
## For realfast team alignment — NOT for external distribution

---

## 1. WHO IS EQT

EQT is the second-largest private equity firm globally by fundraising. EUR 270 billion in assets under management. 273+ portfolio companies spanning healthcare, industrials, tech-enabled services, software, and infrastructure across Europe, North America, and Asia-Pacific.

They are not a financial engineering shop. 94% of their value creation at exit comes from operational improvement — revenue growth, margin expansion, capability building. They make businesses better, not just cheaper. That's their brand and their track record: +8% average annual sales growth, +12% EBITDA growth across the portfolio.

They operate through what they call the **Troika model**: an EQT advisory partner, the portfolio company CEO, and the board work as a three-party unit to execute a "Full Potential Plan" during the hold period. They also maintain an industrial network of 600+ external advisors — former CEOs, functional experts, and domain specialists — who serve as board members and operational mentors across the portfolio.

**The relevant insight:** EQT already thinks in terms of deploying capability across a portfolio. They do it with people (600+ advisors), they do it with operating playbooks, and they do it with acquired assets (Perficient). They have a structural appetite for partners that work at portfolio scale. AI execution is a gap in that portfolio-scale toolkit. That's the opening.

## 2. EQT'S AI POSITION — WHAT THEY'VE BUILT

EQT has invested heavily in AI at the firm level:

- **Motherbrain** (est. 2016): Proprietary AI platform for deal sourcing and due diligence. Scans 50+ data sources, 140K+ data points. Has directly sourced 15 investments. Motherbrain Labs extends this to portfolio companies — unpacking AI risks/opportunities, prototyping solutions, delivering proof of concepts. Motherbrain is EQT's internal AI operating system at fund level.

- **EQT Digital** (~40 professionals): Global team across Nordics, DACH, and North America. Co-led by Sven Tornkvist and Petter Weiderholm. They define digital opportunities, validate tech solutions, and build capability inside portfolio companies. They are strategists and architects.

- **Strategic partnerships**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, AWS, Microsoft. Foundation model access and infrastructure.

- **Perficient acquisition** ($3B, Oct 2024): 7,000-person digital consultancy. Cloud, data, CX, enterprise platforms. AI/ML is one of many capabilities. New CEO tasked with scaling "AI-native portfolio of digital consulting services."

- **EQT AI Summit** (annual): 75+ tech/AI leaders from across the portfolio. Themes in 2025: governance, culture, adoption, reliability.

**Their stated ambition:** Become the most AI-literate investment organization in the world. Stay 18-24 months ahead of competitors.

**Their thesis for portfolio companies:** AI impacts along three dimensions — productivity (cost/efficiency), innovation (new products/services), and competitive defense (moats against AI-native disruptors). They maintain a "house view" of AI impact by sector.

## 3. WHERE EQT IS VULNERABLE — THE GAP

Despite all of the above, there is a structural execution gap between EQT's AI ambition and what's actually happening — both inside their portfolio and at their own fund level.

**The numbers tell the story:**

| Fact | What It Reveals |
|---|---|
| **40 people in EQT Digital covering 273+ companies** | EQT Digital is a strategy and advisory layer, not a delivery engine. They can set direction. They cannot hands-on implement AI across 273 companies. |
| **Only 20% of EQT's own investment professionals generate the bulk of AI usage** (Q1 2025, published by Tornkvist & Weiderholm) | Motherbrain exists. The partnerships exist. The mandate exists. And still only 1 in 5 of their own people are meaningfully using AI. This is an adoption problem, not a technology problem — and it exists at the firm level, not just the portfolio level. |
| **40%+ of agentic AI projects will be canceled by 2027** (Gartner, cited by EQT) | EQT publishes this stat because they recognise the pilot-to-production gap is the dominant risk. |
| **Only 2% of organisations have deployed AI agents at full scale** (Capgemini, cited by EQT) | EQT's portfolio companies — mid-market, operationally focused, varying digital maturity — are squarely in the 98%. |
| **Motherbrain Labs hands off to "portfolio company or external partners" for implementation** | There's an explicit gap between prototype and production. Someone needs to bridge it. Currently, no one does this at portfolio scale. |

**The adoption gradient — the core insight:**

```
EQT HQ (mandate, tools, partnerships, Motherbrain)  → 20% meaningful AI adoption
Portfolio company leadership                          → Likely 5-15%
Portfolio company operational teams                   → Likely <5%
```

The further you get from EQT's centre of gravity, the lower the adoption. But here's the critical point: **the adoption problem starts at EQT itself.** Motherbrain is powerful technology with 20% real usage. That's the same pattern we see everywhere — building the system is not the hard part. Getting people to use it inside their actual work is. And that's exactly what we solve.

## 4. OUR PLAY — WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY PROPOSING

### What We Are NOT Doing

- **We are NOT positioning as a subcontractor to EQT Digital or Motherbrain.** We don't report to them. We don't take briefs from them. We are not their execution arm.
- **We are NOT pitching to replace Perficient.** We're inviting comparison with Perficient. Different posture entirely.
- **We are NOT selling AI strategy, transformation consulting, or advisory.** No decks, no roadmaps, no maturity assessments.
- **We are NOT asking permission from EQT Digital to access portfolio companies.** We're proposing a partnership to EQT the firm.

### What We ARE Doing

**We are proposing a portfolio-level partnership to EQT where realfast serves as the AI execution partner deployed across their portfolio companies — and, once trust is established, helps reengineer how AI operates at the fund level itself.**

This is a two-phase play:

**Phase 1 — Portfolio Execution (Months 1-12):** Prove our model across portfolio companies. Horizontal AI execution that ships production systems in weeks. Build the track record, demonstrate the adoption methodology, earn trust.

**Phase 2 — Fund-Level Engagement (Year 2+):** Apply the same methodology to EQT's own internal AI adoption challenge — including Motherbrain. Help reengineer their operating system for superior use cases and adoption.

### The Distribution Logic

- **realfast's problem:** We need access to enterprise clients across industries. Building pipeline company-by-company is slow, expensive, and doesn't compound.
- **EQT's problem:** They need AI execution happening inside portfolio companies at scale, and they have an internal adoption problem at fund level that they've publicly admitted.
- **The partnership:** EQT endorses and distributes us across the portfolio. We execute. Results compound. EQT gets measurable value creation at portfolio level. Then we apply the proven methodology at fund level. We get 273 doors plus the firm itself through one relationship.

### What We Deliver at Each Portfolio Company
1. One workflow, one business metric, one AI system in production (3-6 weeks)
2. Measured before/after impact on the metric that matters
3. Full handover — the company owns the system
4. Expansion roadmap based on proven results

### What EQT Gets at Fund Level
1. A scalable AI execution capability available to every portfolio company — a new value creation lever
2. Cross-portfolio pattern recognition and benchmarks (we learn from each engagement and feed insights back)
3. EBITDA improvement that compounds across the hold period and shows up at exit
4. A differentiated value creation story for fundraising and LP conversations
5. Eventually: a partner who has proven — inside their own portfolio — that they know how to drive AI adoption, applied to Motherbrain and EQT's internal operations

### What We Get
1. 273+ potential engagements through one partnership
2. Cross-industry pattern recognition that becomes our proprietary advantage
3. Portfolio-level credibility (working across EQT's companies is a tier-one reference)
4. Compounding stickiness — portfolio companies first, then the firm itself
5. A reference client that proves we work at every level: operational teams, portfolio company leadership, and fund-level operating systems

## 5. WHAT WE NEED TO BELIEVE (ASSUMPTIONS)

| Assumption | Confidence | Risk if Wrong |
|---|---|---|
| **EQT will engage on a fund-level partnership, not just a one-off vendor relationship** | Medium. PE firms think in portfolio scale. But it depends on who we reach and how we frame it. | If they treat us as a one-off vendor for a single portfolio company, we still get an engagement — but we lose the distribution model. Need to hold the portfolio-scale framing from the start. |
| **Portfolio companies have operational friction that AI can address in weeks, not months** | High. Backlogs, manual processing, decision latency exist everywhere. | If the workflows are too complex or too regulated for a 5-6 week engagement, we adjust scope. Phase 1 must be chosen carefully. |
| **Our playbook actually works across industries with consistent speed and quality** | Must be proven. This is the Phase 1 test. | If we can't deliver cross-sector, the horizontal positioning collapses. Phase 1 and Phase 2 must demonstrate this explicitly — ideally in different sectors. |
| **The adoption gradient is real — portfolio companies are materially behind on AI** | High. Near-certain for operationally focused mid-market companies. | If portfolio companies are further along than we think, our value prop weakens. Unlikely for the majority but possible for tech/software portfolio companies. |
| **EQT can and will actively endorse us across their portfolio** | Medium. Depends on how their internal process for cross-portfolio initiatives works. | If each portfolio company is fully autonomous on vendor selection, EQT can't "distribute" us top-down. We'd shift to an endorsed referral model — slower but still viable. |
| **The Motherbrain engagement is reachable after building portfolio-level trust** | Medium. Motherbrain is a crown jewel — they'll be protective. | If EQT won't let us near Motherbrain, the Phase 2 play doesn't materialise. The Phase 1 portfolio play must be valuable enough on its own. |

## 6. NAVIGATING EQT'S INTERNAL LANDSCAPE

### Perficient — Use Them as the Benchmark, Not the Objection

EQT spent $3B on Perficient. They believe in it. Don't fight that. Use it.

**The move:** Instead of defensively explaining how we're different from Perficient, invite the comparison directly. "Run us on the same problem, same portfolio company, same timeline. Let the results speak."

**Why this works:**
- It signals supreme confidence. No subcontractor asks to be benchmarked against the client's $3B asset.
- It turns the objection ("why not Perficient?") into a proof event. If we ship a production system in 5 weeks while Perficient is still in discovery, the conversation is over.
- It de-risks EQT's decision. They're not choosing us over Perficient — they're running a low-cost test alongside their existing capability.
- It creates an undeniable data point. Speed, cost, adoption, impact — all measurable, all comparable.

**The framing in the room:** "You've invested heavily in Perficient and that's the right call for large digital programs. We think we're the right call for fast, focused AI execution. Rather than debate it, let's prove it. Pick a portfolio company, pick a workflow. Give us both 6 weeks. Compare the output."

**If we win the bake-off:** realfast becomes the proven fast-execution option EQT deploys alongside Perficient. Coexistence by demonstrated capability, not by argument.

**If we lose:** We learn where our model breaks and EQT respects us for putting ourselves on the line. Even the downside builds credibility.

### EQT Digital — Navigate, Don't Subordinate

EQT Digital (Tornkvist and Weiderholm) is a stakeholder we need to be aware of and aligned with — but they are not our client, our manager, or our gatekeeper.

**Why they matter:** They influence which digital/AI initiatives get attention at portfolio companies. They curate vendor networks. If they actively oppose us, life gets harder.

**Why they're not the target:** Our pitch is a fund-level value creation partnership. That's above EQT Digital's scope. EQT Digital advises on digital strategy. We're proposing something to EQT's partners and operating model.

**How to handle them:**
- Respect what they do. Don't claim to replace any of their functions.
- Be clear on scope: we execute AI in production against specific workflows. We don't do digital strategy, maturity assessments, or technology selection. No overlap.
- If they want to introduce us to portfolio companies, great. If they don't, we should have our own pathway through EQT's partner/advisor network or direct portfolio company relationships.
- Don't position realfast's success as dependent on EQT Digital's endorsement. That's subcontractor framing.

### Motherbrain — Respect It, Then Improve It

Motherbrain is EQT's crown jewel. Built over a decade. Proprietary. Central to their identity as an AI-forward firm. Approach with respect — but understand that it has the same adoption problem everything else does.

**On day one:** Acknowledge Motherbrain's sophistication. Do not suggest it needs fixing. That would be arrogant and would kill the relationship before it starts.

**After portfolio-level trust is built:** The 20% adoption stat is the door. Our portfolio company results will demonstrate — with hard evidence — what drives AI adoption: embedding AI in existing workflows, not deploying a tool and hoping people use it. When we have that evidence from inside EQT's own portfolio, the conversation about Motherbrain opens naturally: "The same dynamics that limited adoption at [portfolio company X] before we worked with them are the same dynamics limiting Motherbrain usage internally. We've proven the fix."

## 7. ENTRY STRATEGY — WHO AND HOW

**The ideal entry point is at the EQT partner/operating level — the people who think about portfolio-wide value creation.**

| Target | Why | What They Care About |
|---|---|---|
| **EQT Partners (deal team leads, operating partners)** | They own the value creation plan for specific portfolio companies. They decide what resources get deployed. | EBITDA impact, hold period returns, exit readiness. |
| **Per Franzen (CEO)** or senior operating leadership | Sets firm-wide priorities for portfolio value creation | Fund-level differentiation, LP story, scalable value creation levers |
| **Sven Tornkvist / Petter Weiderholm (EQT Digital)** | They'll be consulted. Better to have them aligned than surprised. | Relevant as stakeholders, not as the decision-makers for a fund-level partnership. Engage early so they're not blindsided. |
| **Portfolio company CEOs** (via EQT endorsement) | Direct users of our service. The people with the operational friction. | Cost, throughput, SLAs, headcount pressure. They need to see this as EQT-backed, not a random vendor cold call. |

**Entry strategy:**
1. Reach EQT through a warm introduction — ideally at the partner/operating level, not the digital team
2. Pitch the portfolio-scale value creation opportunity — "we're a capability you can deploy across your companies"
3. If Perficient comes up: invite the bake-off. "Run us side by side. Same problem, same timeline."
4. Propose Phase 1: select one portfolio company together, one workflow, 5-6 weeks
5. Results create the proof for cross-portfolio expansion
6. Keep EQT Digital informed and aligned — but don't make them the bottleneck

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't go directly to portfolio companies without EQT's endorsement. That undermines the distribution model and signals we don't understand PE dynamics.
- Don't pitch to EQT Digital as if they're the buyer. They're an advisory team, not the investment committee.
- Don't lead with technology. Lead with fund-level economics: EBITDA, exit multiples, portfolio-scale value creation.
- Don't mention the Motherbrain play early. Earn it first.

## 8. THE BIGGER PLAY: MOTHERBRAIN (Phase 2+)

**This is not for the first conversation. This is for after we've earned trust through portfolio-level execution.**

### The Opportunity

Motherbrain is EQT's proprietary AI operating system — deal sourcing, due diligence, portfolio support. It's powerful technology. But EQT's own published data shows only 20% of their investment professionals drive the bulk of AI usage. The system exists. Adoption doesn't.

This is the same pattern we solve at portfolio companies. The technology is there. The embedding into actual workflows isn't. The result: an expensive, capable system running at a fraction of its potential.

### The Insight We'll Have Earned

By the time we've deployed across multiple portfolio companies, we'll have demonstrated — with measured results — what actually drives AI adoption: embedding AI inside existing workflows so people's work gets easier, not asking people to adopt a new tool. That's our core thesis, proven at scale across EQT's own portfolio.

### The Pitch (When the Time Is Right)

"We've now shown you across [X] portfolio companies what drives AI adoption. The pattern is consistent: it's not about the tool, it's about how the tool fits into the work. Your own Motherbrain has the same adoption challenge at fund level that your portfolio companies had at the operational level. The same approach that moved adoption from single digits to 80%+ at [portfolio company] can be applied to how your investment teams use Motherbrain. Let us help you reengineer the use cases and workflows around Motherbrain to drive the adoption your technology deserves."

### What This Achieves

- **Moves realfast from portfolio-level partner to firm-level partner.** We're no longer just working with portfolio companies — we're embedded in EQT's core operating system.
- **Addresses EQT's admitted internal adoption gap with a proven methodology.** Not theoretical. Proven across their own portfolio companies.
- **Creates near-impossible displacement.** Once you're inside a firm's core AI operating system, switching costs are enormous.
- **Opens a fundamentally larger revenue opportunity.** Fund-level engagements are higher-value, longer-duration, and more strategic than individual portfolio company work.
- **Completes the story.** We've proven we drive AI adoption at the operational level (portfolio companies), at the leadership level (portfolio company management teams), and at the fund level (EQT's own teams). That's a full-stack AI execution capability that no one else can claim.

### Sequencing — Do NOT Rush This

| Phase | What | When |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Prove** | Portfolio company execution — ship production AI systems, measure impact | Months 1-6 |
| **2. Build trust** | Cross-portfolio results across sectors, cross-sector proof of horizontal model | Months 6-12 |
| **3. Seed the idea** | "We've seen this adoption pattern before — inside your own portfolio. The same dynamics apply at fund level." | Month 12+ |
| **4. Propose** | Motherbrain engagement scoping — use cases, workflow redesign, adoption engineering | Year 2 |

**Why this sequencing is non-negotiable:** Motherbrain is a decade-old crown jewel. Suggesting we can improve it before we've proven anything would be arrogant, presumptuous, and would kill the relationship. We earn this conversation through results, not through a pitch.

---

## 9. SUCCESS CRITERIA — HOW WE KNOW THIS IS WORKING

| Milestone | What It Means | Timeline |
|---|---|---|
| **Meeting with EQT partner or operating leadership** | We're in the right conversation at the right level | Weeks 1-4 |
| **Perficient bake-off agreed** (or Phase 1 without bake-off) | EQT is willing to test us — ideally head-to-head | Weeks 4-8 |
| **Phase 1 delivered, metric moved** | We can do what we say we can do | Weeks 8-14 |
| **Second engagement (different sector)** | The horizontal model works — this is the proof that unlocks scale | Weeks 14-24 |
| **Framework agreement for cross-portfolio deployment** | We're embedded in EQT's value creation toolkit | Months 6-12 |
| **Motherbrain conversation opens** | EQT trusts us enough to discuss fund-level AI | Year 1-2 |
| **EQT references us in LP or fundraising context** | We're part of their differentiation story | Year 1-2 |

---

## 10. RISKS AND MITIGATIONS

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **EQT treats us as a one-off vendor, not a portfolio partner** | Medium | High | Hold the portfolio-scale framing from the first conversation. Don't accept a single engagement without explicitly framing it as Phase 1 of a portfolio play. |
| **"Why not Perficient?" kills the conversation** | Medium | High | Invite the bake-off. "Run us side by side. Same problem, same timeline, same portfolio company. Let the results speak." This turns the objection into a proof event. |
| **Phase 1 fails** — we can't move the metric in 5-6 weeks | Low | Very High | Select the workflow carefully. Prefer backlogs and manual processing over complex decision support. Pick something we know works. Don't let ambition kill the proof point. |
| **EQT Digital sees us as a threat and blocks access** | Low-Medium | Medium | Be transparent about scope. We don't do strategy, advisory, or digital maturity. Zero overlap with what they do. Engage them as stakeholders early so they're not surprised. |
| **Portfolio companies resist external help** | Medium | Medium | This is why EQT's endorsement matters. Coming in as "the AI execution partner EQT works with across their portfolio" is categorically different from a cold vendor pitch. |
| **EQT's decentralised model means they can't deploy us top-down** | Medium | Medium | If top-down doesn't work, shift to an endorsed referral model. EQT recommends, portfolio company decides. Slower but still a distribution advantage over going company-by-company alone. |
| **Scope creep** — EQT or portfolio company wants a bigger engagement | Low-Medium | Medium | Hold the line. Our differentiation is speed and focus. The moment we agree to a 6-month program, we become a small Perficient and lose every competitive advantage we have. |
| **Motherbrain play gets blocked — EQT won't let us near it** | Medium | Medium | The portfolio play must be valuable enough on its own. Motherbrain is the upside, not the foundation. If it never happens, the portfolio partnership is still a strong business. |

---

## 11. THE BOTTOM LINE

**Why EQT:** Second-largest PE firm globally. 273+ companies. Explicit AI mandate. A structural execution gap across the portfolio. An admitted adoption problem at fund level (20% Motherbrain usage). An existing appetite for deploying external partners at portfolio scale. And a $3B investment in Perficient that we can benchmark against, not hide from.

**Our play — two phases:**

1. **Portfolio execution partnership:** Prove horizontal AI execution across portfolio companies. Use EQT as a distribution node into 273+ companies. Build the track record. If invited, run head-to-head against Perficient and let the results speak.

2. **Fund-level engagement:** Once trust is earned through portfolio results, help EQT reengineer Motherbrain's use cases and adoption. Apply the same methodology that worked across their portfolio to their own internal operating system.

**What must go right first:** Phase 1. One portfolio company, one workflow, measurable impact. Everything else follows from this. If we deliver, the distribution model opens. If we don't, nothing else in this brief matters.

**The asymmetry:** The cost to EQT of testing this is trivial — $50-150K and 5-6 weeks. The upside of getting it right — a scalable AI execution capability across a 273-company portfolio, plus a path to improving their own internal AI adoption — is a category-defining partnership for both firms.
