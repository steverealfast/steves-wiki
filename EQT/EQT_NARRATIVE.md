# realfast x EQT: Sharpened Narrative
## AI Execution for Portfolio Value Creation

---

# STRATEGIC CONTEXT (Internal — Not for Deck)

## Why EQT, Why Now

**EQT's stated position:** AI adoption is existential. They want to be the most AI-literate investment organization in the world, 18-24 months ahead of competitors.

**EQT's structural problem:** 40 professionals in EQT Digital. 273+ portfolio companies. That's one digital advisor per ~7 companies. EQT Digital is an architect, not a general contractor. They "define key opportunities, validate technical solutions, and build capabilities" — then hand off execution. Motherbrain Labs prototypes but explicitly hands off to "portfolio company or external partners" for implementation.

**The gap we fill:** EQT needs execution partners who can take what EQT Digital identifies and turn it into production systems that move EBITDA. That's us.

**The Perficient question:** EQT acquired Perficient for $3B (Oct 2024) — a broad digital consultancy with AI capabilities. Any pitch to EQT must pre-empt: "Why not use Perficient?" Answer: Perficient is a 7,000-person generalist consultancy doing cloud, data, CX, and enterprise platforms. We are AI-native execution specialists. They design digital strategies. We ship AI systems that hit production in weeks, not quarters. Different tool, different job.

**EQT's own data against them:** They cite 40%+ of agentic AI projects will be canceled by 2027. Only 2% of organizations have deployed AI agents at full scale. Even internally, only 20% of their investment professionals fully utilize AI tools. The problem isn't ambition — it's execution. This is our entire thesis.

# THE DECK — EQT VERSION

---

## Slide 1 — Title

**AI Execution That Moves EBITDA.**
Faster proof. Lower risk. Portfolio-scale impact.

*realfast — AI delivery for portfolio value creation*

---

## Slide 2 — The Problem EQT Knows

**AI ambition across your portfolio is not the bottleneck. Execution is.**

EQT Digital identifies the right opportunities. Motherbrain validates the thesis. Portfolio companies say yes.

Then what?

- Internal teams lack AI delivery capability
- System integrators scope 6-month engagements before a line of code runs
- Pilots stall. Budgets burn. Confidence erodes.

**The result:** Proven AI opportunities sit idle while competitors ship.

*Your own data: 40%+ of agentic AI projects will be canceled by 2027. Only 2% reach full scale. The failure point is between "approved" and "in production."*

## Slide 3 — Why AI Execution Fails in Portfolio Companies

**It's structural, not technical.**

| Failure Mode | What Happens | Economic Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **Scope creep** | Pilot grows into a "platform" before proving anything | 3-6 months lost, $500K-$2M burned |
| **Tool-first thinking** | AI treated as a product to install, not a capability to embed | System sits unused 90 days post-launch |
| **No workflow ownership** | AI bolted on to existing process, not rewired into it | <5% adoption, zero ROI |
| **Measurement void** | No before/after baseline, so no proof of value | Can't justify expansion, can't justify cost |

**The common thread:** Teams start too broad, measure too late, and iterate too slowly.

---

## Slide 4 — Our Governing Principle

**Contain risk. Prove value. Then — and only then — expand.**

We engineer AI initiatives where:
- Scope is narrow enough to ship in weeks
- Proof is measured against a real business metric on day one
- Expansion is earned by results, not promised in a roadmap

This mirrors how EQT thinks about value creation: **evidence before commitment, compounding returns from proven positions.**

No big-bang transformations. No speculative pilots. No scale without proof.

---

## Slide 5 — Where Portfolio Company Work Breaks Down

Before applying AI, we classify why execution is slow. Every inefficiency falls into one of three categories:

| | AUTOMATE | AUGMENT | CONNECT |
|---|---|---|---|
| **The problem** | Humans doing unnecessary manual work | Humans making decisions without adequate support | Systems and data that don't talk to each other |
| **Symptoms** | Backlogs, errors, high cost-to-serve | Slow decisions, inconsistent quality, missed signals | Manual reconciliation, partial visibility, slow handoffs |
| **AI mechanism** | Rules-based automation, extraction, validation | Scoring, recommendations, first-draft generation | Cross-system matching, unified views, data stitching |
| **EBITDA lever** | Cost reduction, throughput increase | Revenue quality, speed-to-decision | Operational efficiency, error reduction |

This classification drives where we start — and what we measure.

---

## Slide 6 — The Sweet Spot: Where We Start in Portfolio Companies

**Not every workflow is worth automating first. We start where the math works fastest.**

Selection criteria:

| Filter | Why It Matters |
|---|---|
| **Direct business metric** | Cash, cost, SLA, conversion — something the CFO already tracks |
| **Repeatable workflow** | High frequency = fast learning loop = faster proof |
| **Existing data** | No data engineering project required before AI can run |
| **Contained blast radius** | Failure doesn't cascade; success is clearly attributable |

**This is where:**
- Risk is contained to a single workflow
- Proof comes in weeks, not quarters
- Expansion earns itself through demonstrated impact

---

## Slide 7 — Safe Entry Points Across EQT's Portfolio

**Problems we're confident are safe, fast, and high-impact starting points:**

| Entry Point | Typical Portfolio Relevance | Example Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| **Execution backlogs** | Operations teams drowning in manual processing | 60-80% reduction in processing time |
| **Decision-to-execution latency** | Analysis paralysis, slow approvals, information fragmentation | Decisions that took days → hours |
| **Cost-to-serve pressure** | SLA misses, rising headcount to maintain throughput | 15-30% cost-to-serve reduction |
| **Revenue leakage** | Manual quoting, inconsistent pricing, slow customer response | Measurable revenue recovery within weeks |

These are entry points — not limitations. Once proven, the same execution model expands.

**Sector applicability across EQT's portfolio:**
- **Healthcare** (IVC Evidensia-type): Scheduling, patient workflow, clinical documentation
- **Tech-enabled services** (Vistra-type): Compliance processing, document extraction, client onboarding
- **Industrial** (Anticimex-type): Field operations optimization, predictive maintenance workflows
- **Software** (IFS-type): Customer support automation, internal dev productivity

---

## Slide 8 — One Playbook, Many Doors

**Regardless of which portfolio company, which sector, or which entry point — we run the same execution model:**

1. **Narrow scope** — One workflow, one metric, one team
2. **Constrained delivery** — Working system in production within 3-6 weeks
3. **Prove before expanding** — Measured impact against baseline before any scope increase

This is how we stay useful across a diverse portfolio without becoming vague.

**For EQT, this means:** A repeatable model that EQT Digital can deploy across portfolio companies with predictable timelines, costs, and outcomes. One engagement proves the model. Subsequent deployments accelerate.

---

## Slide 9 — What We Actually Deliver

**Tangible outcomes. Not presentations.**

| Deliverable | What It Means |
|---|---|
| **Production-ready AI system** | Live, in-workflow, used by real people — not a demo |
| **Measured before/after impact** | Hard numbers on the business metric that justified the project |
| **Operational documentation** | The portfolio company can maintain and evolve the system |
| **Clear expansion path** | Where to go next, with projected impact, based on proven patterns |

**What the CFO sees:** A line item that moved. Cost went down, throughput went up, or revenue improved — with attribution.

**What EQT Digital sees:** A proven AI capability embedded in a portfolio company that can be referenced, replicated, and scaled.

---

## Slide 10 — Why This Is Low Risk (The EQT Lens)

**Designed for how PE actually evaluates commitments:**

| Risk Dimension | How We Contain It |
|---|---|
| **Financial exposure** | Narrow scope = small initial commitment. Typical Phase 1: $50-150K |
| **Timeline risk** | 3-6 weeks to production. Not months. |
| **Adoption risk** | We embed in existing workflows, not bolt on a new system |
| **Dependency risk** | Portfolio company owns the system. Full handover included. |
| **Measurement risk** | Baseline established before build starts. Impact measured against it. |

**Net position:** The cost of a failed experiment is a rounding error on a portfolio company's OpEx. The upside of a successful one compounds across the hold period.

---

## Slide 11 — How We Fit Into EQT's Value Creation Model

**We are not a replacement for EQT Digital. We are the execution engine they need.**

```
EQT Digital (Strategy + Opportunity Identification)
        ↓
Motherbrain Labs (Validation + Prototyping)
        ↓
  ┌─────────────────────────┐
  │   realfast (Execution)  │  ← We operate here
  │   Workflow → Production │
  │   In weeks, not months  │
  └─────────────────────────┘
        ↓
Portfolio Company (Ownership + Ongoing Operation)
```

**The Troika alignment:**
- **EQT Advisory Partner** sets strategic direction
- **Portfolio Company CEO** owns the business outcome
- **realfast** delivers the AI system that achieves it

We extend EQT Digital's capacity without adding headcount. We convert Motherbrain's prototypes into production systems. We give portfolio company management teams a delivery partner that moves at PE speed.

---

## Slide 12 — Portfolio Scale: The Multiplier Effect

**One engagement proves the model. Cross-portfolio deployment is the compounding play.**

| Phase | Scope | Investment | Timeline |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Phase 1: Prove** | 1 portfolio company, 1 workflow | $50-150K | 3-6 weeks |
| **Phase 2: Validate** | 2-3 portfolio companies, similar use case | $150-400K | 6-12 weeks |
| **Phase 3: Scale** | Cross-portfolio deployment, playbook codified | Framework pricing | Ongoing |

**Why this matters for EQT's returns:**
- Each successful deployment improves EBITDA at the portfolio company level
- Proven AI capabilities increase exit multiples (buyers pay more for digitally mature businesses)
- A codified AI execution playbook becomes part of EQT's differentiated value creation toolkit
- Cross-portfolio patterns reduce marginal cost of each subsequent deployment

**The fund-level math:** If AI execution improves EBITDA by even 2-5% across 10 portfolio companies, the aggregate value creation on a EUR 22B fund is measured in hundreds of millions.

## Slide 13 — Why realfast (Not Perficient, Not a Big 4)

| | realfast | Perficient | Big 4 / SI |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Core capability** | AI-native execution | Broad digital consulting | Enterprise advisory |
| **Time to production** | 3-6 weeks | 3-6 months | 6-12 months |
| **Team model** | Senior engineers, small teams | Mixed seniority, large teams | Junior-heavy, large teams |
| **Pricing model** | Outcome-anchored, contained scope | Time & materials, scope grows | Time & materials, scope grows |
| **AI depth** | Purpose-built for AI delivery | AI is one of many capabilities | AI is a practice area |
| **Risk profile** | Small bet, fast proof | Large commitment, delayed proof | Large commitment, delayed proof |

**The honest positioning:** Perficient is the right partner for enterprise digital transformation programs. We are the right partner when you need a specific AI system in production, fast, with measurable results. Different tool, different job.

---

## Slide 14 — How Engagements Begin

**A simple, low-commitment starting point:**

1. **EQT Digital identifies a portfolio company with an AI opportunity** (or we do, based on sector patterns)
2. **Joint scoping call** — 1 hour. Define: one workflow, one metric, success criteria.
3. **2-week discovery sprint** — Map the workflow, establish baseline, design the AI mechanism
4. **3-4 week build + deploy** — Working system in production with real users
5. **Measure and decide** — Hard numbers on impact. Expand, iterate, or stop.

**Total elapsed time from handshake to measured impact: 5-6 weeks.**

No procurement process required. No 50-page SOW. One decision, one workflow, one proof point.

---

## Slide 15 — Close

**You don't need more AI strategy.**
**You need AI systems in production — across your portfolio — that move the numbers.**

See real impact before you bet on transformation.

# APPENDIX: EQT-SPECIFIC TALKING POINTS

## For Sven Tornkvist / Petter Weiderholm (EQT Digital Co-Heads)

**Lead with:** "You have 40 people covering 273 companies. We want to be the execution capacity you bring in when a portfolio company is ready to go from identified opportunity to production system."

**Anticipate:** "How is this different from what Perficient does?"
**Answer:** "Perficient is a 7,000-person digital consultancy. They're the right call for a multi-year digital transformation. We're the right call when you need one AI system live in 5 weeks. Different scale, different speed, different price point. We complement Perficient, we don't compete with it."

**Anticipate:** "We have Motherbrain Labs for this."
**Answer:** "Motherbrain Labs prototypes and validates. We take what they've validated and put it into production. We're the implementation partner that catches what comes out of Motherbrain — so your portfolio companies don't lose momentum between 'this could work' and 'this is working.'"

**Anticipate:** "How do we know this works?"
**Answer:** "You don't — yet. That's why Phase 1 is one company, one workflow, $50-150K. If we don't move the number, you're out a small sum and 6 weeks. If we do, you have a repeatable model for 272 other companies."

## For Portfolio Company CEOs

**Lead with:** "We're here to ship one AI system that measurably improves one business metric you already track. That's it. 5-6 weeks, start to measured result."

**Anticipate:** "We've tried AI before and it didn't stick."
**Answer:** "It didn't stick because it was bolted on, not built in. We embed AI inside a workflow your team already uses. They don't adopt a new tool — their existing work gets easier. That's the difference between 5% adoption and 85% adoption."

## For EQT Investment Committee / Partners

**Lead with the fund math:** "If AI execution drives even a 3% EBITDA improvement across 10 portfolio companies in Fund X, the incremental value creation at exit — assuming conservative multiple expansion — is EUR 200-500M. The cost to test this thesis is less than EUR 500K across Phase 1 and Phase 2."

# WHAT THIS NARRATIVE DOES DIFFERENTLY FROM THE ORIGINAL DECK

| Original Deck | EQT Version | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Generic "organisations" | EQT portfolio companies specifically | PE firms think in portfolio value, not abstract clients |
| No economic framing | EBITDA, cost-to-serve, fund-level math | PE speaks in returns and multiples |
| "Accelerated Delivery" tagline | "AI Execution That Moves EBITDA" | CFOs don't buy delivery speed — they buy impact |
| No competitive positioning | Explicit Perficient and Big 4 comparison | EQT will ask. Pre-empt it. |
| No portfolio scale story | Phase 1 → 2 → 3 with fund-level math | The multiplier effect is EQT's entire thesis |
| No integration with EQT structure | Explicit Troika model alignment, EQT Digital complement | Shows you've done your homework. Reduces "not invented here" risk. |
| "Tangible outcomes, not presentations" | Specific deliverables + what the CFO sees vs. what EQT Digital sees | Different stakeholders need different proof |
| Vague "How Engagements Begin" | 5-step process with timeline and cost | Decision-makers need enough to say yes or no |
