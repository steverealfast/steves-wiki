# realfast x EQT: Narrative v2
## EQT as Distribution Node — Portfolio-Wide AI Execution

---

# STRATEGIC CONTEXT (Internal — Not for Deck)

## The Real Play

**We are not pitching EQT Digital for a seat at their table. We are pitching EQT the fund as a distribution channel into 273+ companies across healthcare, industrials, tech services, and infrastructure.**

One relationship. One proven model. 273 doors.

## The Adoption Gradient — Why This Works

The 20% stat is the linchpin. Here's how the logic cascades:

| Layer | AI Adoption Reality | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **EQT HQ** (investment professionals) | ~20% meaningful usage | Their own published data (Q1 2025). These are PE professionals at a firm spending millions on AI infrastructure, with Motherbrain, OpenAI/Anthropic partnerships, and a mandate from the CEO. |
| **Portfolio company leadership** (CEOs, CFOs, COOs) | Likely 5-15% | Less AI-literate, less infrastructure, competing operational priorities. They attend an annual EQT AI Summit — but go home to legacy systems and manual processes. |
| **Portfolio company operational teams** (the people doing the work) | Likely <5% | No AI tools, no training, no workflow integration. These are the people processing documents, running compliance checks, managing scheduling, doing reconciliation. |

**The implication:** The portfolio is where the value is trapped. EQT's mandate, resources, and ambition live at the top. The operational reality at the bottom is manual, slow, and expensive. There is no mechanism to bridge that gap at scale. That's us.

**The distribution argument to EQT:** "You have the mandate, the portfolio, and the relationships. You don't have a scalable way to deploy AI execution across 273 companies. We do. One proven playbook that works horizontally across industries and use cases. You point, we execute."

## Why EQT Specifically (vs. Other PE Firms)

1. **Scale:** 273+ companies, EUR 270B AUM. Enough portfolio density to justify a partnership model.
2. **Stated intent:** They've publicly declared AI adoption "existential." This isn't cold outreach — they've already decided AI matters.
3. **Proven gap:** 40 people in EQT Digital covering 273 companies. They cannot execute. They need distribution partners.
4. **Existing vendor model:** EQT explicitly "curates a network of advisors, consultants and tech vendors." They're built to work through external partners. We're not proposing something foreign — we're fitting into a slot that already exists.
5. **Cross-portfolio pattern:** Because we work horizontally, we'll develop pattern recognition across their portfolio that no individual company or vertical specialist can match. This becomes a proprietary insight layer we feed back to EQT.

## What We're NOT Doing

- We are NOT trying to win EQT Digital as a client
- We are NOT positioning as a subcontractor to EQT Digital or Motherbrain
- We are NOT selling AI transformation strategy
- We are NOT competing with Perficient for large digital programs

**We ARE positioning as:** A horizontal AI execution partner that EQT deploys across their portfolio as part of their value creation toolkit — the same way they deploy operational advisors, board members, and procurement optimization.

# THE DECK — EQT VERSION (v2)

---

## Slide 1 — Title

**One AI execution partner.**
**273 portfolio companies.**
**Measurable impact in weeks.**

*realfast — Portfolio-scale AI execution*

---

## Slide 2 — The Adoption Gap EQT Already Knows Exists

**Your ambition is ahead of your portfolio's capacity to execute.**

EQT has declared AI adoption existential. You've built Motherbrain, partnered with OpenAI and Anthropic, hired 40 professionals in EQT Digital, and hosted an AI Summit for 75+ tech leaders across your portfolio.

And yet:

- Only 20% of your own investment professionals generate the bulk of AI usage (your published data, Q1 2025)
- 40%+ of agentic AI projects will be canceled by 2027 (Gartner, cited in your own publications)
- Only 2% of organizations have deployed AI agents at full scale (Capgemini, cited in your own publications)

**If adoption is 20% at EQT HQ — with all your resources and mandate — what is it inside a mid-market healthcare business, an industrial services company, or a compliance services firm in your portfolio?**

The answer: It's close to zero. Not because they don't want AI. Because they don't have the capability to execute it.

---

## Slide 3 — The Real Problem: No Delivery Mechanism at Portfolio Scale

**EQT has the strategy. The portfolio lacks the execution capacity.**

| What EQT Has | What the Portfolio Lacks |
|---|---|
| AI thesis and mandate from the top | Internal AI engineering capability |
| Motherbrain for deal sourcing and prototyping | Ability to take prototypes to production |
| EQT Digital for strategic guidance | Hands-on execution partners who ship |
| Perficient for broad digital transformation | Fast, focused AI-specific delivery |
| Relationships with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google | People who can turn those tools into working systems inside actual workflows |

**The bottleneck is not ideas, strategy, or technology. It's the last mile: getting an AI system into a real workflow, used by real people, improving a real metric — across 273 companies that all need it but can't do it themselves.**

---

## Slide 4 — What We Do

**We are a horizontal AI execution partner. We deploy across industries and use cases with one proven model.**

Before applying AI to any workflow, we classify the friction:

| AUTOMATE | AUGMENT | CONNECT |
|---|---|---|
| Humans doing unnecessary manual work | Humans making decisions without adequate support | Systems and data that don't talk |
| Backlogs, errors, high cost-to-serve | Slow decisions, inconsistent quality | Manual reconciliation, partial visibility |
| **Mechanism:** Extraction, validation, straight-through processing | **Mechanism:** Scoring, recommendations, draft generation | **Mechanism:** Cross-system matching, unified views |
| **EBITDA lever:** Cost reduction, throughput | **EBITDA lever:** Revenue quality, decision speed | **EBITDA lever:** Operational efficiency |

**These patterns repeat across every industry EQT invests in.** The workflow details change. The underlying friction is the same. That's why we work horizontally.

---

## Slide 5 — Why Horizontal Works (The Pattern Recognition Advantage)

**The same friction shows up everywhere. The industry wrapper changes — the core problem doesn't.**

| Friction Pattern | In Healthcare | In Industrial Services | In Tech-Enabled Services | In Financial Services |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Execution backlog** | Patient intake processing | Field service scheduling | Client onboarding documentation | Claims processing |
| **Decision latency** | Clinical triage prioritization | Maintenance scheduling decisions | Pricing and quoting | Underwriting assessment |
| **Cost-to-serve pressure** | Staff scheduling vs. demand | Route optimization | Compliance checking | Transaction reconciliation |
| **Data disconnection** | Patient records across systems | Asset data across sites | Client data across platforms | Regulatory data across jurisdictions |

**What this means for EQT:** One engagement teaches us patterns that accelerate the next. By the third portfolio company, we're faster, cheaper, and more accurate — because we've already solved the structural problem elsewhere in the portfolio.

**This is the compounding advantage a horizontal partner delivers that a vertical specialist never can.**

---

## Slide 6 — Where We Start: The Sweet Spot

**Not every workflow is worth automating first. We start where the math works fastest.**

| Selection Criteria | Why |
|---|---|
| **Direct business metric** | Cash, cost, SLA, conversion — something the CFO already tracks |
| **Repeatable workflow** | High frequency = fast proof |
| **Existing data** | No data engineering prerequisite |
| **Contained blast radius** | Failure stays local; success is clearly attributable |

**Safe entry points we're confident in across any EQT portfolio company:**
- Execution backlogs (manual processing that creates cost and delay)
- Decision-to-execution latency (information is there, synthesis is manual)
- Cost-to-serve or SLA pressure (headcount rising to maintain throughput)
- Revenue leakage (manual quoting, slow response, inconsistent pricing)

These aren't limitations. They're the doors that open everything else.

---

## Slide 7 — One Playbook, Every Door

**The same execution model, regardless of industry, company size, or use case:**

1. **Narrow scope** — One workflow, one metric, one team
2. **Ship in weeks** — Working system in production within 3-6 weeks
3. **Measure against baseline** — Before/after impact on the metric that matters
4. **Expand only from proof** — Next workflow earns its way in based on results

**This is how we stay horizontal without becoming vague.** We don't need to understand your entire business. We need to understand one workflow deeply enough to make it measurably better. Then we move to the next.

**For EQT, this means:** A repeatable model you can offer every portfolio company. Same playbook, predictable timelines, predictable costs, measurable outcomes. The portfolio company gets a production AI system. You get a proven value creation lever.

---

## Slide 8 — What Portfolio Companies Receive

**Tangible outcomes. Not slide decks about AI.**

| Deliverable | What It Means |
|---|---|
| **Production AI system** | Live, embedded in a real workflow, used by real people |
| **Measured business impact** | Before/after on the metric that justified the project |
| **Operational handover** | The company owns and maintains the system |
| **Expansion roadmap** | Where to go next, with projected impact, based on what we proved |

**What the portfolio company CFO sees:** A cost line that dropped, a throughput number that climbed, or a revenue metric that improved — with clear attribution.

**What EQT sees:** A repeatable proof point that works. A result you can reference when the next portfolio company asks "does AI actually work for businesses like ours?"

---

## Slide 9 — The EQT Distribution Model

**How this works as a portfolio-scale partnership:**

```
                    EQT (Distribution Partner)
                    |
        ┌───────────┼───────────┐
        |           |           |
   Healthcare   Industrials   Services   ... (273+ companies)
        |           |           |
   ┌────┴────┐ ┌────┴────┐ ┌────┴────┐
   │realfast │ │realfast │ │realfast │
   │Playbook │ │Playbook │ │Playbook │
   │(same)   │ │(same)   │ │(same)   │
   └─────────┘ └─────────┘ └─────────┘
        |           |           |
   Proven       Proven       Proven
   Impact       Impact       Impact
```

**The flywheel:**
1. **EQT identifies** portfolio companies ready for AI execution (or we do, based on sector patterns)
2. **We execute** using our standard playbook — same model, adapted to the workflow
3. **Results feed back to EQT** — cross-portfolio pattern recognition, sector benchmarks, proven use cases
4. **EQT deploys us to the next company** with a track record and reference case from inside their own portfolio

**What makes this sticky:** Every engagement gives us deeper pattern recognition across EQT's portfolio. By year two, no outside firm understands EQT's portfolio-level AI opportunity better than we do. That's a moat for both of us.

## Slide 10 — The Economics

**Phase model designed for PE risk appetite:**

| Phase | What Happens | Investment | Timeline | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Prove** | 1 portfolio company, 1 workflow | $50-150K | 3-6 weeks | Rounding error on OpEx |
| **Validate** | 2-3 companies, cross-sector | $150-400K | 6-12 weeks | Contained, comparable |
| **Scale** | Cross-portfolio deployment | Framework pricing | Ongoing | Proven model, known outcomes |

**The fund-level math (conservative):**

- Assume 10 portfolio companies with one AI execution engagement each
- Assume average EBITDA improvement of 3% per company (conservative for backlog and cost-to-serve use cases)
- On a portfolio with average EBITDA of EUR 50M per company, that's EUR 1.5M incremental EBITDA per company
- At a 15x exit multiple: EUR 22.5M incremental enterprise value per company
- Across 10 companies: **EUR 225M incremental value creation**
- Cost to achieve: <EUR 2M total across all Phase 1 + Phase 2 engagements
- **Return on AI execution spend: >100x**

*These numbers are illustrative. The actual math depends on portfolio company size, sector, and hold period. But the ratio of cost-to-test vs. potential value creation is extreme.*

## Slide 11 — Why realfast (Not the Alternatives)

**EQT will have options. Here's why we're the right fit for this specific play.**

| | realfast | Perficient (EQT-owned) | Big 4 / SI | Boutique AI Labs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Built for** | Horizontal AI execution across a portfolio | Broad digital transformation | Enterprise advisory | Deep tech R&D |
| **Speed** | 3-6 weeks to production | 3-6 months | 6-12 months | Varies |
| **Portfolio fit** | Same playbook, any industry | Engagement-by-engagement | Engagement-by-engagement | Narrow specialization |
| **Cross-portfolio learning** | Pattern recognition compounds | Each engagement is standalone | Each engagement is standalone | No portfolio view |
| **Team model** | Senior AI engineers, small | Mixed seniority, large | Junior-heavy, large | Research-oriented |
| **Pricing** | Outcome-anchored, contained | T&M, scope grows | T&M, scope grows | Project-based |

**The honest answer to "why not Perficient?":** Perficient is a 7,000-person consultancy that does cloud, data, CX, and platform work. AI is one of many things they do. We do one thing: take a specific workflow and put AI into production around it, fast. Perficient is the right call for a multi-year digital transformation. We're the right call when a portfolio company needs one AI system live in 5 weeks. Different tool for a different job. They coexist.

---

## Slide 12 — How It Starts

**One decision. One company. One workflow.**

1. **Joint selection** — EQT identifies a portfolio company with operational friction we can address (or we propose one based on sector patterns)
2. **Scoping call** — 1 hour. One workflow, one metric, success criteria defined.
3. **Discovery sprint** — 2 weeks. Map the workflow, establish baseline, design the AI mechanism.
4. **Build + deploy** — 3-4 weeks. Working system in production with real users.
5. **Measure + decide** — Hard numbers. Expand to next workflow, next company, or stop.

**Total: 5-6 weeks from handshake to measured impact.**

After Phase 1, the conversation changes from "will this work?" to "where do we deploy next?"

---

## Slide 13 — Close

**You have 273 companies that need AI execution.**
**You have 40 people who can't deliver it at that scale.**
**You have the mandate, the relationships, and the portfolio.**

**What you need is a partner who can execute horizontally — across your industries, your use cases, your companies — with a proven, repeatable model.**

**That's one conversation.**

# APPENDIX: TALKING POINTS BY AUDIENCE

## For Sven Tornkvist / Petter Weiderholm (EQT Digital Co-Heads)

**The reframe:** Don't position as seeking their approval. Position as solving their capacity problem.

**Lead with:** "You've built something smart with EQT Digital — the strategy layer, the vendor network, the portfolio oversight. But you're 40 people across 273 companies. You need execution partners who can go in, ship something that works, and create a reference case you can use at the next portfolio company. That's what we do. We want to be the AI execution partner you send into companies when they're ready to move."

**Anticipate:** "We have Perficient for this."
**Answer:** "Perficient is brilliant for broad digital transformation — cloud, CX, platforms. When a portfolio company needs one AI system live in 5 weeks against a specific workflow, that's a different job. We do the focused, fast play. Perficient does the comprehensive one. They'd actually refer work to us for the same reason a general contractor refers to a specialist electrician."

**Anticipate:** "How do we know you can work across our sectors?"
**Answer:** "Because the friction patterns are the same. A document processing backlog in healthcare looks structurally identical to one in compliance services. A decision-latency problem in industrial scheduling is the same class of problem as one in financial underwriting. The workflow details change. The AI mechanism doesn't. That's why horizontal works — and why every engagement makes the next one faster."

**Anticipate:** "What's the ask?"
**Answer:** "One portfolio company. One workflow. 5-6 weeks. If we move the number, we'll both want to do it again. If we don't, you're out a small sum and some time. The asymmetry is heavily in your favor."

## For Portfolio Company CEOs

**Lead with:** "EQT asked us to help you get one AI system into production against a workflow that's costing you time or money. It's a 5-6 week engagement. We pick one workflow, measure where it is today, build an AI system around it, and measure the impact. You keep the system. If it works, we talk about what's next. If it doesn't, you've lost nothing material."

**The key move:** Frame this as EQT-endorsed. The portfolio company CEO needs to see this as part of EQT's value creation offering, not an unsolicited vendor pitch. The distribution model only works if realfast comes in under EQT's imprimatur.

## For EQT Partners / Investment Committee

**Lead with the portfolio math:** "You've built the AI thesis. You have the mandate. The question is delivery. 40 people can't execute AI across 273 companies. But a horizontal execution partner with a repeatable playbook can. The cost to prove this is <$150K. The value of getting it right — even across 10 portfolio companies — is measured in hundreds of millions of incremental enterprise value at exit."

**The distribution pitch:** "Think of us the way you think about operational advisors in your industrial network. You don't have 600 advisors on payroll — you have a network. We're the AI execution equivalent. One proven partner you deploy repeatedly, with compounding returns from cross-portfolio pattern recognition."

# WHAT CHANGED FROM v1 TO v2

| v1 Framing | v2 Framing | Why the Shift |
|---|---|---|
| "We complement EQT Digital" | "EQT is a distribution channel into 273 companies" | We don't want to be a subcontractor. We want portfolio-scale access. |
| Positioned under EQT Digital in the value chain | Positioned as a horizontal partner EQT deploys | Peer relationship, not subordinate |
| 20% stat used as a general adoption problem | 20% stat used to infer the adoption gradient — if HQ is 20%, portfolio companies are near zero | Stronger argument: the opportunity at portfolio level is massive and untapped |
| Focus on one company at a time | Focus on the portfolio-scale flywheel and compounding pattern recognition | The multiplier is the real value prop |
| Competitive positioning vs. Perficient | Perficient acknowledged but de-emphasized — different tool, coexist | Don't make Perficient a threat. They're a $3B EQT asset. Position as complementary. |
| Talking points for EQT Digital as gatekeepers | Talking points that frame EQT Digital as capacity-constrained and needing distribution partners | Same people, different appeal: we solve their scale problem |
| Generic "how we fit" | Explicit distribution model diagram with flywheel logic | Shows this is a partnership model, not a one-off engagement pitch |
