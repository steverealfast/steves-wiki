Create a 13-slide PowerPoint presentation using the master template I've uploaded. Use the file EQT_DECK_v3.md as the content source for every slide. Follow every instruction below precisely.

## AUDIENCE

Senior private equity professionals — partners, operating partners, and digital/technology leadership at a EUR 270B fund with 273+ portfolio companies. They are:

- Highly analytical. They read dozens of decks daily and will skim first.
- Allergic to vendor marketing, buzzwords, and hype. If it looks like a sales deck, they disengage.
- Trained to evaluate risk, returns, and operational leverage. They think in EBITDA and exit multiples.
- Time-poor. Every slide must earn its place.

This deck must look like it was made by operators, not by a marketing team.

## HOW TO READ THE CONTENT FILE

The content file (EQT_DECK_v3.md) uses four tags:

- [ON SLIDE] = Text and visual elements that appear on the slide itself. Only this content is visible during presentation.
- [SPEAKER NOTES] = The presenter's script. Put this in the PowerPoint speaker notes field. Never put this content on the slide.
- [VISUAL] = A table, diagram, or graphic element to build on the slide.
- [FOOTNOTE] = Small attribution text (8-9pt) at the bottom of the slide.

## SLIDE-BY-SLIDE DESIGN DIRECTION

### Slide 1 — Title
Three-line hero statement, large, centred. Subtitle/tagline below in smaller text. Clean. Confident. No imagery needed. Let it breathe.

### Slide 2 — The Adoption Challenge
Hero statement top-left or centred. Four bullets below with generous spacing between each. Footnote bar across the bottom — three stats separated by pipe characters, in small text. The footnote should feel like a data citation, not a headline.

### Slide 3 — The Execution Gap
Hero statement top. Two-column comparison table below. Left column in a neutral/light colour. Right column highlighted using the template's accent colour to draw the eye — that's the gap, which is where the audience should focus. Clean table, minimal borders.

### Slide 4 — What We Do
Hero statement top. Three equal-width columns below — each with a header (AUTOMATE / AUGMENT / CONNECT), description row, mechanism row, and EBITDA lever row. Use the template palette to differentiate columns (e.g., three shades or accent colour for headers only). Bottom statement centred below the columns. This is a framework slide — structured and clean.

### Slide 5 — Why Horizontal Works
Hero statement top. Matrix table below — row headers (friction patterns) on the left in bold or accent colour, column headers (industries) across the top. Keep cell text to 2-3 words max. Subtle colour banding on rows. Bottom statement centred. The audience should be able to scan any row and immediately see the pattern repeating across sectors.

### Slide 6 — Where We Start
Hero statement top. Four selection criteria displayed as cards, tiles, or numbered blocks — NOT as a plain bullet list. Each card has the criteria name in bold and the explanation in lighter text below. Entry points at the bottom as a single line with pipe separators, or as four small tags/pills. This slide should feel selective and disciplined.

### Slide 7 — One Playbook, Every Door
Hero statement top. Four steps displayed as a horizontal process flow — numbered circles or arrows connecting left to right. NOT a vertical bullet list. This should feel like a methodology visual. Bottom statement centred below the flow.

### Slide 8 — What Portfolio Companies Receive
Hero statement top. Four deliverables as cards/tiles in a 2x2 grid — bold title with one-line description under each. Bottom callout in a subtle highlight box or with an accent left-border — this should stand out as the key takeaway for the CFO persona in the audience.

### Slide 9 — The Partnership Model
Hero statement top-left. Hub-and-spoke diagram takes up the main body of the slide — this is a visual-first slide. Show EQT at the top as the hub, three branches to sector labels (Healthcare, Industrials, Services, plus "..." suggesting more), a "realfast Playbook" box under each (identical, showing repeatability), and arrows converging to a "Cross-Portfolio Intelligence" block at the bottom. Flywheel steps sit to the right of the diagram or below it as a numbered list. Diagram is the centrepiece. Keep it clean using template shapes and colours only.

### Slide 10 — The Economics
Hero statement top. Phase table clean with three rows — consider using the accent colour for the Prove row (the entry point). Fund-level math in a callout box or highlighted section below the table. Use bold formatting for "EUR 225M" and ">100x" — these are the numbers that make PE professionals lean forward. Small footnote at bottom. The design should make the asymmetry between cost and upside impossible to miss.

### Slide 11 — Why realfast
Hero statement top. Comparison table — highlight the realfast column with a subtle background colour or left border to draw the eye, without being obnoxious. Other columns in neutral tones. Bottom statement centred, slightly larger than body text. Do NOT make this feel like a typical vendor comparison chart. Keep it factual and understated. The confidence is in the invitation to test, not in self-congratulatory formatting.

### Slide 12 — How It Starts
Hero statement top. Five steps as a horizontal timeline — left to right with numbered nodes, step title, and one-line description under each. "5-6 weeks" callout at the bottom in larger or bold text — this is the anchor number. Consider a subtle timeline graphic showing the total 5-6 week span. This should feel like a clear, simple process.

### Slide 13 — Close
Three statements, stacked, centred, with generous breathing room between each. The final line — "That starts with one conversation" — should be in the accent colour or slightly larger. Clean. Confident. No clutter. Contact details or realfast logo at the bottom per the template.

## GLOBAL DESIGN RULES

1. Sparse over dense. If in doubt, remove an element. White space is intentional.
2. No stock photography. No abstract AI imagery. No handshake photos. No circuit boards.
3. Tables over paragraphs. Comparative or structured content always uses a table.
4. Process flows over bullet lists. Sequential content uses horizontal flows, not vertical bullets.
5. One hero statement per slide. This is the largest text on the slide. Everything else supports it.
6. Speaker notes are complete scripts. Write them as full paragraphs the presenter can read verbatim.
7. Footnotes are citations. Small, factual, bottom of slide. Never promotional.
8. Colour discipline. Template palette only. Accent colour for emphasis — used sparingly on hero statements, key numbers, and the realfast column in comparisons.
9. Font hierarchy. Three levels max: hero statement (largest), body text (medium), footnotes (smallest). No decorative fonts.
10. No gradients, shadows, or 3D effects on any element.
11. Table styling: minimal borders, colour banding from template palette, clean alignment.
12. Diagram styling: template shapes only, flat colours, no drop shadows, clean connecting lines.
