# SCR Story Arc Framework — The CIO Dilemma Article

## Situation → Complication → Resolution

## How SCR Works

SCR is the oldest persuasive structure there is. McKinsey uses it. The best op-eds use it. Every compelling pitch uses it — whether the person knows it or not. Sidu's "There Is No Product" follows it precisely.

The power of SCR is that it mirrors how the reader's mind already works: I understand the world this way (Situation) → something has changed that breaks my understanding (Complication) → here is the new way to see it (Resolution).

## S — Situation

**What the reader already believes to be true.**

This is not background. This is the reader's current mental model — the assumptions they walk in with. You establish the Situation so the reader nods along: "Yes, this is how I see it." You are building common ground before you pull it out from under them.

**Rules:**
- State it as fact, not opinion. The reader should feel seen, not set up.
- Be specific. Don't say "technology is changing." Say what the reader actually thinks about how technology is changing.
- Keep it tight. The Situation is not the star — it's the setup. 200-400 words max.
- End the Situation at the point where the reader is comfortable. They think they know where this is going.

**Structural test:** If the reader stopped reading after the Situation, would they feel like they already knew this? They should. That's the point.

### Situation Template

```
[What is the accepted reality?]
[What does the reader's world currently look like?]
[What do most people in this position believe, do, and assume?]
[What has been true for long enough that nobody questions it?]
```

---

## C — Complication

**The thing that breaks the Situation.**

This is where the essay earns its existence. The Complication is not a problem — it's a *contradiction*. Something has changed that makes the Situation untenable. The reader's comfortable understanding doesn't work anymore, and you show them exactly why.

The Complication should create dissonance. The reader should feel the ground shift. This is where the contrarian open from the Writer Voice kicks in: "Everyone is focused on the symptom. Here's what actually broke."

**Rules:**
- The Complication must be *surprising but obvious in hindsight*. The reader should think: "How did I not see this?"
- It must be irreversible. Not a temporary disruption — a structural shift. Something that can't be undone.
- It should reframe the Situation, not just add new information. The facts don't change — the interpretation does.
- The Complication is where your framework lives. This is where you give the reader the new lens.
- This is the longest section. 40-50% of the essay lives here. Take the time to build it.

**Structural test:** After reading the Complication, can the reader go back to the Situation and still believe it? If they can, the Complication didn't land.

### Complication Template

```
[What changed?]
[Why does this break the assumptions in the Situation?]
[What is the new framework / lens for seeing this?]
[What evidence proves this isn't temporary?]
[What does this mean for the person in the Situation?]
[Why can't they just adapt within their current model?]
```

### Complication Sub-Structures

The Complication often has internal architecture. Common patterns:

**The Reframe:** "You thought this was X. It's actually Y."
- Sidu: "You thought software was an asset. It's actually inventory."

**The Squeeze:** Two forces converging on the reader from opposite directions.
- "The board demands AI transformation. The CIO was hired to buy software, not build it. Both of these are true. Neither can be ignored."

**The Timeline:** Showing the shift happening in real time — what was true 2 years ago, what's true now, what will be true in 18 months.
- "In 2024, AI autocompleted code. In 2025, it built components. In 2026, it builds full applications. The line only moves in one direction."

**The Unmasking:** Revealing that a role/function/assumption was always something different than what people called it.
- "The CIO was never a technology leader. The CIO was a procurement officer."

## R — Resolution

**The new way to see the world — and what to do about it.**

The Resolution is NOT a to-do list. It is the inevitable conclusion of the Complication. If the Complication was built correctly, the Resolution should feel obvious — the reader should arrive at it just before you state it.

The Resolution answers: "Given that the Situation is broken and the Complication is irreversible, what is the new reality? What does the reader now need to accept?"

**Rules:**
- The Resolution must be earned. If you can state the Resolution without the Complication, the essay structure is broken.
- It should feel like a verdict, not advice. You're not telling them what to do — you're telling them what's true.
- Keep it tight. The Resolution is a landing, not a runway. 200-400 words.
- End with a door closing. The reader cannot go back to the Situation.

**Structural test:** Does the Resolution follow inevitably from the Complication? Can the reader argue with it? If the structure is right, they can't — because every premise was established and earned in the preceding sections.

### Resolution Template

```
[What is now true that wasn't before?]
[What is the new mental model the reader should adopt?]
[What does this mean for how they act, decide, or see their role?]
[What is the verdict — stated without hedging?]
```

## How SCR Maps to the Writer Voice

| SCR Stage | Writer Voice Technique | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Situation** | Concrete anchors, "here's what everyone believes" | Build common ground, establish credibility |
| **Complication** | Contrarian pivot, reframing framework, rhetorical questions | Create dissonance, deliver the new lens |
| **Resolution** | Short sentences that hit, the verdict close | Land the argument, close the door |

## How SCR Maps to the Editor Checklist

| Editor Test | SCR Application |
|---|---|
| Is the argument earned? | Does S build enough common ground for C to land? |
| Does each section earn the next? | S → C must feel like the ground shifting. C → R must feel inevitable. |
| Single controlling framework? | The framework lives in C. There should be exactly one. |
| Opening hooks within 200 words? | S must establish stakes fast — not background, not history. |
| Examples doing work? | Examples in S ground the reader. Examples in C prove the shift. Examples in R are unnecessary. |
| Skeptical reader test? | The skeptic's objections should be preempted in C, not R. |
| Close delivers a verdict? | R is the verdict. If it reads like a summary, the structure failed. |

## Working Template (Fill In When Drafting)

### SITUATION
> *[What does the reader currently believe? What is the accepted reality? What has been true for so long nobody questions it?]*

### COMPLICATION
> *[What broke? What changed? Why is the Situation no longer tenable? What is the new framework? What evidence makes this irreversible?]*

### RESOLUTION
> *[What is now true? What must the reader accept? What is the verdict?]*

## Reference: How Sidu's Essay Maps to SCR

| Section | SCR Stage | What It Does |
|---|---|---|
| "Is SaaS dead?" discourse | **S** | Establishes what everyone is talking about |
| "The Wrong Question" | **S→C transition** | Shows the discourse is looking at the symptom |
| "Asset vs. Inventory" framework | **C** | Delivers the new lens |
| "The Line" | **C** | Shows the shift happening in real time |
| "There Is No Product" | **C→R transition** | The framework's inevitable conclusion |
| "Below the line, there is no product" | **R** | The verdict. Door closes. |
