# The CIO Dilemma: The Bottleneck Nobody Talks About

---

## Everyone Agrees. That's the Problem.

Every enterprise board in the world is asking the same question: what's our AI strategy? The CEO is under pressure to show transformation. The PE fund wants AI on the value creation plan yesterday. Competitors are making announcements - most of them vapour.

McKinsey's 2026 Global Technology Agenda confirms it. Half of all companies identify AI as a top priority. Two-thirds of top performers say their CIO is "very involved" in enterprise strategy. The language has shifted - from "keep the lights on" to "co-create business strategy." InformationWeek, Gartner, Forrester - everyone is telling the same story with different fonts.

And the ecosystem has repositioned to match. [Infosys launched Topaz](https://www.infosys.com/newsroom/press-releases/2025/launching-topaz-fabric.html) with 50 pre-built AI agents. [Accenture reorganised its entire company](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2025/accenture-changes-growth-model-to-reinvent-itself-for-the-age-of-ai) around "Reinvention Services." [Wipro committed $1 billion to ai360](https://www.wipro.com/newsroom/press-releases/2023/wipro-launches-wipro-ai360-commits-to-investing-1-billion-in-ai-over-the-next-three-years/). [Cognizant launched Neuro AI](https://news.cognizant.com/2025-03-25-Cognizant-to-Deploy-Neuro-AI-Platform-to-Accelerate-Enterprise-AI-Adoption-in-Collaboration-with-NVIDIA). Every major SI and consulting firm has staked its claim. The capital is flowing. The partnerships are announced. The playbooks are ready. Everyone is aligned.

But consensus is not insight. Every person in every boardroom in every industry agreeing that AI matters tells you _squat_ about whether any of them can actually execute on it. The mainstream narrative describes what CIOs should already know and be executing. Instead the room does what it's always done. It buys something.

One AI tool for customer support. Another for FP&A. Another for developer productivity. By the time the procurement tender is signed, the stack has shifted and the consultant deck you paid for is already redundant.

None of this is new. This is enterprise procurement on autopilot - same as it's been for thirty years. What to buy, from whom, on what terms, and how to wire it in without breaking what's already running. The entire ecosystem around the CIO - the SIs, the consultants, the vendor relationships - exists to serve that one question: _what do we buy?_

That question just changed. And nobody handed out a new playbook.

## The Real Friction Is Not at the Top

McKinsey, helpful as ever, surveyed 632 technology leaders on what's holding them back. They got the answers the room always gives. Nearly a third cite AI talent as a top challenge. AI budgets grow while operating metrics stay flat. The instinct is to blame the usual suspects.

These are real constraints. They're also the wrong diagnosis.

The friction is not at the top. It never was. This isn't a strategy problem or a budget problem. The friction is in the execution layer - the infrastructure of decision-making, procurement, governance, and delivery through which every AI initiative must pass. Infrastructure that was purpose-built for a completely different kind of decision. Infrastructure that nobody is willing to name as the bottleneck because the people who built it are the same people being asked to transform it.

Consider what happens when a CIO greenlights an AI initiative. It enters the same procurement pipeline as every ERP upgrade and platform migration before it. A requirements document gets drafted. An RFP goes out. SIs respond with twelve-month roadmaps and staffing plans calibrated to their bench capacity, not your timeline. Governance reviews add weeks. Security sign-off adds more. By the time the initiative clears the machinery, the model it was scoped against has been superseded twice and the competitive window has closed.

That's the bottleneck. Not the technology. Not the strategy. Not the talent. The apparatus. And every quarter it stays in place, the gap between what the board expects and what the execution layer can deliver gets wider - not incrementally, but compoundingly. Because the companies that figured this out aren't waiting.

## The Decision That Disappeared

For thirty years, the CIO's central decision was clear: _what do we buy?_

Build was never seriously on the table. The cost and risk of building software internally made buying the only rational choice. And CIOs were exceptionally good at it. Vendor evaluation. Contract negotiation. Integration planning. Licence optimisation. Managing a complex ecosystem of SIs, consultants, and platforms across geographies and business units. Genuinely sophisticated work.

But let's be honest about what that made them. The CIO was the most important technology decision-maker in the enterprise - not because they understood technology, but because they understood _procurement_ at a scale and complexity that most executives couldn't touch. The CIO was a procurement officer. The best one in the building. And that was exactly what the enterprise needed.

An entire industry existed to serve this model. System integrators implemented. Consultants advised. Vendors sold. The CIO orchestrated. Time and materials became the default billing model. Multi-year rolling contracts became the goldmine. Labour arbitrage became the differentiator - offshore delivery centres turning headcount into margin. Everyone was aligned around the same question: what do we buy, from whom, on what terms? It was a self-reinforcing ecosystem with self-reinforcing economics. And it worked - because the decision underneath it was stable.

Those economics just collapsed.

Software that was supposed to take eight months and $300K to implement - and routinely went on to twelve-month delays and $900K in overage - can now be delivered in weeks for under $100K. An HRMS. A reporting dashboard. A customer portal. The categories keep expanding.

This is the shift my cofounder [Sidu describes in "There Is No Product"](https://sidu.in/essays/after-ai-there-is-no-product.html): software moved from being an _asset_ - expensive to create, hard to replicate, worth buying - to _inventory_ - cheap to manufacture, easy to replicate, worth building yourself. The line between what's still an asset and what's become inventory only moves in one direction. Every model generation pushes it higher.

The CIO's decision didn't evolve. It disappeared. "What do we buy?" is no longer the central question. The new decision - "what do we build, what do we buy, and how do we tell the difference before we waste six months finding out?" - is a fundamentally different problem. And the entire apparatus built around the old decision has no mechanism for making the new one. Not a weak mechanism. No mechanism.

The role was defined by a world that no longer exists. That's not a commentary on anyone's competence. It's a structural fact. And pretending otherwise is how enterprises burn through AI budgets without moving a single operating metric.

Which raises a question nobody in the enterprise seems willing to ask out loud: if the CIO's role was defined by a decision that no longer exists - what is the CIO's role now?

And while the enterprise sits with that question, the apparatus that served the old answer is still running. Still billing. Still optimising for a decision that no longer exists.

## The Apparatus Resists Velocity

Infosys launched Topaz. Accenture reorganised around Reinvention Services. Wipro committed a billion dollars. Cognizant launched Neuro AI. Every major SI staked its claim. The capital was flowing. The playbooks were ready.

Revenue per employee across the major IT services firms sits at roughly $50K. It hasn't meaningfully moved. TCS nearly doubled revenue from $16 billion to $30 billion over the past decade. Headcount also nearly doubled. The most successful IT services firm in the world spent ten years proving that its business model can't improve. Every additional million dollars of revenue still requires approximately 20 new employees. This isn't opinion. It's arithmetic from their own annual reports.

When RPE does tick up - as it did for Infosys in FY2024 - it's driven by hiring freezes, not productivity. Wipro's RPE actually _declined_. The top five firms shed nearly 58,000 employees in two years. They'll rehire when deals return. RPE will revert. It always does. The flatline isn't a blip. It's the model.

Revenue scales linearly with bodies. Labour arbitrage is the margin. Utilisation rates run at 84-85% across the industry and haven't meaningfully improved. The entire economic engine is calibrated to one thing: large, predictable, long-duration contracts delivered through headcount.

A client comes to their SI partner - the same partner running a $30 million multi-year engagement - and says: we need a $300K AI project delivered in six weeks. The SI's own people will tell you privately that they can't do it profitably. A sales engineer at one of the major cloud platforms described it directly: "We are not designed to do $150K-$300K projects on profit. Our entire org is designed to sign and deliver on $3 million dollar deals." The client implies a bigger deal will follow, so refusing isn't an option. But the economics of servicing it don't work.

This isn't because the engineers are too slow. It's because the _pipeline_ is too slow. Requirements gathering, pre-sales, legal review, compliance, security assessment, staffing, project management - every one of these functions was built for high-value, low-frequency engagements. The cost of processing a $300K deal through that pipeline approaches the cost of processing a $30 million deal. The organisational overhead per deal is roughly constant regardless of deal size.

Grant every engineer in the building a Cursor licence. Give them Devin. Make them twice as fast, three times as fast. The bottleneck moves to legal. Then compliance. Then pre-sales. Then staffing. The _firm_ doesn't get faster. Individual engineers get faster. That's the alpha everyone is touting. It's the wrong alpha.

And the legacy business isn't shrinking to make room. Mega-deals of $100 million or more hit record volumes in the past 24 months. Average contract durations are growing, not falling. The traditional book of business is still there - still large, still profitable, still demanding the same delivery apparatus. What's happening isn't a replacement. It's a bifurcation. Two markets demanding fundamentally different economics from the same apparatus. Legacy deals that the apparatus was built for, and AI-native deals that it structurally cannot serve.

McKinsey's own senior partner, Noshir Kaka, described it at NASSCOM's technology forum in February 2026: "Legacy spends are compressing significantly faster, causing a huge operating model change for IT firms." He called it "one of the biggest transitions since going offshore." Meanwhile, customers are arriving at contract renewals expecting a 20-40% "AI discount" - productivity gains they assume their vendors have already captured. The vendors haven't captured them. They _can't_ capture them - because the gains require a delivery model they don't have.

HCLTech's CEO called it "a painful transition, painful reinvention" and described value migrating away from services companies entirely. The same week, Anthropic announced that Claude Code could sharply reduce the cost of modernising legacy systems. The Nifty IT index dropped 6% in a single session. Infosys ADRs fell 8.4%. Cognizant lost roughly 10%. SI leadership called the reaction "overblown." Cognizant's CEO insisted the assumption was "misplaced." Vinod Khosla said the industry would need to "do something dramatically different" by 2030. But don't worry - they're all in on AI. Buying opportunity of a lifetime.

The defensive posture is the tell - look at the numbers underneath the rebrand. Actual AI-native delivery accounts for under 6% of revenue at even the most aggressive firms. Accenture's generative AI revenue is 3.9% of $69.7 billion. Infosys claims 5.5%. The other 94% is traditional IT services. Same labour model. Same utilisation economics. Same linear scaling.

The CIO's most trusted partners are structurally incentivised to slow down the very transformation they've been hired to deliver. Not maliciously. Economically. Their business model depends on the old decision surviving. Every AI initiative that moves fast and light is a direct threat to the revenue model that pays their people. And the CIO routes every initiative through them - because the apparatus has no other path.

So the CIO does what the apparatus allows. They buy a point solution.

## The Point Solution Trap

Four AI vendor contracts in twelve months. The CIO does what they've always done.

And it feels like progress.

Seventy percent of enterprise AI budgets aren't new money. They're repurposed from existing technology spend - legacy ADM contracts cut, services budgets trimmed, maintenance agreements consolidated. Money moving from one line item to another through the same procurement apparatus that processed ERP spend for thirty years. Different vendor name on the contract. Same process underneath.

But nobody asked the prior question. _Is this function actually the bottleneck?_

Optimise month-end closing and discover the real constraint was upstream data quality. Accelerate FP&A and find the real friction was in how leadership consumed the output. Deploy a support chatbot and realise the issue was never response time - the product had a defect nobody escalated.

The bottleneck moves. The spend goes up. The operating metrics stay flat. The pattern repeats in every boardroom running this playbook. Six AI vendor contracts signed in twelve months. Someone eventually asks the question nobody can answer: what problem are we actually solving? Put the technology aside - what's broken? Nobody knows. They have the tools. They don't have the diagnosis.

The apparatus has no mechanism for the question that should come _before_ the purchase order: where is the actual constraint? The old playbook never needed that step. When you're buying ERP, you know what you're buying. When you're deploying AI, the first question is _where_ - and every vendor in the market has a structural incentive to tell you the answer is wherever their tool sits.

The diagnostic capability doesn't exist. Not because the CIO lacks intelligence. Because the entire ecosystem around them - the SIs, the consultants, the vendors - is optimised for a different question. They're optimised for _what do we sell you_, not _what's actually broken_. The consulting firm scopes a twelve-week assessment. The SI proposes a phased implementation. The vendor runs a proof of concept against the function they happen to serve. None of them have an incentive to tell the CIO that the bottleneck is three departments away from where the budget is pointing.

ROI on AI remains elusive across the enterprise. Of course it does. The enterprise is spending on AI the same way it spent on everything else - through procurement logic, not diagnostic logic. Negotiating price when they should be finding the constraint. Buying tools when they should be mapping the pipeline. Applying the old decision-making apparatus to a problem that the old apparatus was never designed to solve.

The point solution trap isn't a mistake. It's the inevitable output of a procurement-optimised system encountering a problem that requires diagnosis first. And every quarter the CIO spends buying instead of diagnosing, the gap compounds. Because the companies that figured this out aren't buying point solutions. They're rewiring how execution happens. The data already shows who they are.

## The Data Tells You Who Already Figured This Out

McKinsey's own data tells the story they buried in the executive summary.

They surveyed 632 technology and business leaders. The headline was optimistic - CIOs as strategy architects, AI as the top investment priority, budgets rising across the board. That's the consensus the boardroom is running on. Now look at what the data actually says when you stop reading the headline and start reading the segmentation.

Only the top performers - companies with 10% or more growth in both revenue and EBIT over three years - show the deep CIO-business integration McKinsey describes. That's roughly 18% of respondents. The other 82% are running the old model under new pressure. Flat operating metrics. Growing AI budgets. A widening gap between what the board demands and what the execution layer can deliver.

The 82% aren't failing because they lack ambition. They're failing because they're running new initiatives through old infrastructure. Nearly a third cite AI talent as a top challenge. A quarter of even the top performers cite change management. And roughly 40% of the non-top-performers plan to _increase_ outsourcing - doubling down on the very apparatus that is structurally incapable of delivering what they need.

McKinsey calls this a "maturity gap." More honest framing: the decision changed, most organisations haven't changed their decision-making apparatus, and the data shows the cost of that inaction quarter by quarter.

Now look at what the 18% are actually doing. They're not buying AI differently. They're changing _how execution happens_ - insourcing capability that used to sit with SIs, compressing twelve-month roadmaps into weeks-to-production cycles, rewiring operating models around velocity instead of vendor management. They figured out that the apparatus was the problem - and they built around it while everyone else was still running the old playbook and wondering why the metrics didn't move.

The gap between these two groups isn't closing. It's compounding. Every quarter the top performers operate with a rewired execution layer, their context deepens. They understand where the real friction sits. They've built the diagnostic capability the old ecosystem never had. They've compressed the cycle from insight to delivered outcome. Every quarter the 82% spend through the old apparatus, the distance grows - not because they're spending less, but because they're spending _through the wrong system_.

Capital markets are already pricing it. Eight quarters of consensus estimates for the major IT services firms have been trimmed by 2-3% each time. TCS cut 11,000 employees. HCL's headcount is flat. The market isn't panicking. It's structurally repricing an entire delivery model - doing the arithmetic the enterprise hasn't done yet.

The companies pulling ahead aren't the ones with bigger AI budgets. They're the ones that stopped treating the old execution layer as a given and started treating it as the obstacle it is.

The question isn't whether the old ecosystem survives. It's whether anyone will say it out loud.

## The Old Ecosystem Is Done

The CIO dilemma isn't a performance problem. It isn't a training problem. It isn't solved by hiring an AI strategy consultant or standing up a centre of excellence or running a two-day workshop for the leadership team.

It's a structural mismatch between the decision the enterprise needs to make and the apparatus it has for making it. The buy-side playbook. The SI partnerships. The procurement frameworks. The governance structures. Every layer was optimised for a decision that no longer exists. And every quarter the old apparatus stays in place, the distance between what the board expects and what the enterprise delivers compounds. The 18% that figured this out are already compounding.

The new decision requires two capabilities the existing ecosystem cannot provide.

Diagnostic capability. The ability to identify where friction _actually_ sits before choosing a solution. Not where the vendor says it sits. Not where the last consultant assumed. Where the operational data shows it. The old ecosystem never needed this. The new one can't function without it.

Execution at speed. Diagnosis to working solution in weeks, not quarters. Not a roadmap. Not a maturity assessment. A delivered outcome tied to a measurable metric, fast enough to validate the hypothesis before the model underneath has moved again.

Product companies can't - they sell solutions to problems they've pre-defined. Consulting firms can't - they deliver strategies, not working systems. Traditional SIs _won't_. Doing so would destroy the economics their entire business model depends on. You don't ask someone to dismantle their own revenue model and expect urgency.

The companies that don't build it will keep buying. Keep deploying. Keep watching the gap widen - quarter by quarter, board meeting by board meeting - until the competitive distance becomes permanent.

And the question the boardroom still hasn't answered: if the CIO's role was defined by a decision that no longer exists, what is the role now? The enterprises making progress aren't the ones with a clean answer. They're the ones that recognised the question is _open_ - and stopped pretending the old definition still holds.

---

The next wave of enterprise transformation will not be delivered by the same institutions that delivered ERP. The economics won't allow it. The incentives won't allow it. The gap won't wait.

The companies that build the new capability - diagnostic-first, velocity-native, structurally independent of the old apparatus - will compound an advantage that becomes unreachable. Every engagement deepens context. Every solution maps more of the real friction. Six months in, the organisation has an intelligence layer no point solution could have provided - because it was built from _their_ operational data, not a vendor's generic model.

Ask whether your current partners can diagnose before they sell. Whether they can deliver in weeks what they currently quote in quarters. Whether they monetise your outcome or your duration.

If the answer to any of those is no, the old playbook is still running.
