# The CIO Dilemma

Every enterprise board in the world is asking the same question: what's our AI strategy? The CEO is under pressure to show transformation. The PE fund wants AI on the value creation plan yesterday. Competitors are making announcements - most of them vapour.

Meanwhile, every consulting and IT services firm on the planet has an AI transformation playbook they can't wait to run on you. [Infosys has Topaz](https://www.infosys.com/newsroom/press-releases/2025/launching-topaz-fabric.html) with 50 pre-built AI agents. [Accenture reorganised its entire company](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2025/accenture-changes-growth-model-to-reinvent-itself-for-the-age-of-ai) around something called "Reinvention Services." [Wipro committed $1 billion to ai360](https://www.wipro.com/newsroom/press-releases/2023/wipro-launches-wipro-ai360-commits-to-investing-1-billion-in-ai-over-the-next-three-years/). [Cognizant launched Neuro AI](https://news.cognizant.com/2025-03-25-Cognizant-to-Deploy-Neuro-AI-Platform-to-Accelerate-Enterprise-AI-Adoption-in-Collaboration-with-NVIDIA). Different brand names. Same deck. Same promise. Same hyperscaler partnership announced the same week. And the vendor market is right behind them - every product in the enterprise stack rebadged "AI-powered" overnight. Half of it is snake oil. The other half is solving problems nobody at your company actually has.

Across every one of these conversations - board rooms, PE portfolio reviews, transformation kick-offs - someone eventually says: _"Forget the technology for a second. What's the actual problem we're solving?"_ The room goes quiet. Not because nobody knows. Because nobody has done the work to find out.

So the room does what it's always done. It buys something.

One AI tool for customer support. Another for FP&A. Another for developer productivity. By the time the procurement tender is signed, the stack has shifted and the consultant deck you paid for by the hour is already redundant. None of this is new. This is enterprise procurement on autopilot - same as it's been for thirty years. What to buy, from whom, on what terms, and how to wire it in without breaking what's already running. The entire ecosystem around the CIO - the SIs, the consultants, the vendor relationships - exists to serve that one question: what do we buy?

That question just changed. And nobody handed out a new playbook.
