# realfast Investor Narrative v3

> **The Real Story**

---

## The 30-Second Pitch

> **realfast removes the guesswork from enterprise AI. We identify and implement AI workflows that allow decision makers to focus on what matters. Better decisions.**

---

## The Model (What the pitch doesn't say)

We don't just consult and leave. We deploy production systems and stay.

**Services → Platform Deployment → Recurring Managed Services**

Every engagement follows the same arc:
1. Enter through a narrow, safe starting point
2. Deploy AI around existing workflows (not rip-and-replace)
3. Stay as managed services to continuously optimize

**The thesis**: AI is restructuring IT services. We've built the platform that makes this restructuring possible. Capital lets us acquire distribution (relationships + companies) and roll up the market.

---

## Where We Are Today

**Beachhead**: Salesforce ecosystem — accelerated implementations, proven methodology, channel distribution built-in.

**Expansion**: AI transformation services for any enterprise workflow.

Same team. Same platform. Same methodology. Two go-to-market motions.

---

## What We Actually Do

### Phase 1: Services Entry

We enter through a narrow, safe starting point:
- One workflow
- One business metric
- 3-6 weeks to production

We find where AI works — automating tasks, supporting decisions, connecting systems — and prove value before expanding.

### Phase 2: Platform Deployment

We don't just consult and leave. We deploy AI around their existing systems:
- Automation for repetitive tasks
- Decision support for knowledge work
- Connections for fragmented data

This IS the deliverable — production systems that run their business.

### Phase 3: Managed Services

We stay in the account:
- Continuous optimization of workflows
- Platform improvements deployed over time
- Data compounds → outcomes improve

**This is recurring revenue with high retention** — we're embedded in their operations.

---

## The Business Model Economics

| Revenue Type | Characteristics |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Implementation** | Project-based, one-time, funds platform development |
| **Managed Services** | Recurring, high retention, compounds with data |
| **Platform Efficiency** | Cost-to-serve decreases over time as platform matures |

**The margin story**:
- Implementation: Standard services margins
- Managed Services: Higher margins (platform does the work, humans optimize)
- Over time: Revenue per FDE increases as playbooks multiply

---

## What Compounds

Three flywheels spinning simultaneously:

### 1. Data Flywheel
```
More deployments → More workflow data →
Platform digests patterns → Better outcomes →
Better decisions for clients → More referrals →
More deployments → ...
```

### 2. Platform Efficiency Flywheel
```
More usage → More optimization →
Faster/cheaper delivery → Better margins →
More investment in platform → More efficiency → ...
```

### 3. Playbook Leverage Flywheel
```
More patterns encoded → FDEs deploy faster →
Higher capacity per FDE → More clients served →
More patterns discovered → More playbooks → ...
```

**Net effect**: The business gets better at delivery with every client. This is not true for traditional services firms.

## Why Capital — The Roll-Up Thesis

### The Bottleneck

Our bottleneck is not capability — it's **distribution**. Specifically: CXO-level relationships that generate pipeline.

### What Capital Unlocks

| Use of Capital | What It Buys |
|----------------|--------------|
| **Hire partners** | Ex-McKinsey/Accenture partners with CXO rolodex |
| **Acquire SIs** | Small Salesforce partners with existing client relationships |
| **Geographic expansion** | Replicate the model in new markets |

### The Roll-Up Logic

1. **Acquire a small SI** with strong client relationships
2. **Integrate into Exo Cortex platform** — their delivery becomes more efficient
3. **Convert to managed services model** — implementation + recurring revenue
4. **Extract margin** — platform efficiency means higher margins than they had standalone
5. **Repeat** — use improved margins to fund next acquisition

**Why this works**: The platform is the integration engine. We can absorb acquisitions faster and make them more efficient than they could be alone.

---

## The Exit Paths

| Exit Path | How It Works | Likely Acquirer |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Strategic acquisition** | Large SI wants our platform + methodology | Accenture, Deloitte, Cognizant |
| **PE roll-up** | Recurring managed services revenue is attractive | Vista, Thoma Bravo, etc. |
| **Continue scaling** | Become a significant player, IPO eventually | — |

**What makes us valuable**:
- Recurring managed services revenue (predictable, high retention)
- Platform that enables efficient integration of acquisitions
- Compounding data/playbooks that improve delivery over time

---

## Addressing the Skeptic

### "You're just a services business."

**Response**: We're a services business that deploys a platform and converts to recurring managed services. The platform is not vaporware — it's what we leave behind with every client. Managed services is recurring revenue with high retention.

**The math**:
- Services alone = linear scaling
- Services + Platform + Managed Services = compounding returns per client

---

### "Why is this venture-backable?"

**Response**: Three reasons:

1. **Recurring revenue** — Managed services is not project-based; it's ongoing
2. **Compounding efficiency** — Platform gets better, margins expand over time
3. **Roll-up opportunity** — Capital lets us acquire distribution and consolidate a fragmented market

**The venture case**: We're not asking you to bet on services. We're asking you to bet on the platform that makes services efficient + the roll-up strategy that uses capital to acquire distribution.

---

### "What stops Accenture from doing this?"

**Response**: Accenture's business model depends on headcount. Every efficiency improvement threatens their revenue. They can't cannibalize themselves.

We have no legacy to protect. We're built from day one around the assumption that AI should do the work.

**The window**: Large SIs will eventually figure this out. We're betting we can build enough scale and acquire enough distribution before they pivot.

---

### "Where are the proof points?"

**Response**: [This is where we need to add specific evidence]

- Internal velocity metrics from Manazer
- Before/after client outcomes
- Managed services retention rates
- Platform efficiency improvements over time

**Honest gap**: We need to package this evidence better. It exists in our systems but hasn't been compiled for investor scrutiny.

---

### "Why you? Why now?"

**Why now**:
- AI capability has crossed the threshold where this model is possible
- Enterprises are ready to adopt (compliance frameworks exist)
- Large SIs are structurally unable to move fast
- First-mover window is open

**Why us**:
- [Team backgrounds — need your input]
- We've already built the platform (Exo Cortex)
- We've proven it on ourselves before selling it
- Engineering-led, not sales-led

---

## The Ask

**Raising**: [Amount]

**Use of Funds**:

| Allocation | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Partner hires** | 2-3 senior hires with CXO relationships |
| **Acquisition** | 1-2 small SI acquisitions for distribution |
| **Platform development** | Accelerate Exo Cortex roadmap |
| **Geographic expansion** | Replicate Singapore model in [markets] |

**Milestones**:

| Milestone | Target | Timeframe |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Managed services ARR | $[X] | 12 months |
| Clients on platform | [X] | 12 months |
| First acquisition integrated | 1 | 18 months |
| FDE capacity | [X] people | 18 months |

---

## Summary: The Investment Thesis

**What we are**: A services company that deploys a platform and converts to recurring managed services.

**What compounds**: Data, platform capabilities, playbooks — all three make us better at delivery over time.

**What capital unlocks**: Distribution (partner hires + acquisitions) to short-circuit GTM.

**The exit**: Strategic acquisition by large SI, PE roll-up of recurring revenue base, or continued scaling.

**The bet you're making**: AI will restructure IT services, and we've built the platform to be the efficient winner in that restructuring.
