# FTE Productivity Analysis — Feb 1–20, 2026

**Persona:** Jon Gray — CFO. Revenue Architect. Project Economist.
**Scope:** Manazer | FTE cost efficiency, revenue utilization, internal investment, role economics | CEO + Delivery Head
**Data Source:** Verified Fact-Finding Report (98.8% confidence) + Full MCP Project Refresh (Feb 20)
**Period:** Feb 1–20, 2026 (15 business days)
**Generated:** Feb 20, 2026

## 1. Executive Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Active FTEs | 25 (excl. system accounts) |
| Cost Rate Range | $30–$120/hr (4 tiers) |
| Total Estimated Period Spend | $104,160 |
| Revenue-Generating (Client) | $20,299 (19.5%) |
| Presales (Cost of Sales) | $33,375 (32.0%) |
| Internal (Absorbed) | $50,487 (48.5%) |

**The bottom line:** For every dollar spent on FTEs, 19.5 cents produced client revenue, 32 cents went to presales pipeline investment, and 48.5 cents was absorbed internal cost. Nearly half the FTE spend goes to building internal platforms — $50,487/period ($1.3M annualized). Only 5 FTEs have revenue utilization above 20%. The $80/hr tier (9 people, $54,800) is the highest-cost segment with the lowest average output per dollar. The single largest internal cost center is the manazer platform at $21,066/period across 7 contributors. Project tagging is clean — every FTE activity maps to a project with zero nil-project records.

### FTE vs Contractor Comparison

| Metric | Contractors | FTEs | Combined |
|--------|------------|------|----------|
| Headcount | 9 | 25 | 34 |
| Total Est. Spend | $27,600 | $104,160 | $131,760 |
| Avg Cost/Person | $3,067 | $4,166 | $3,875 |
| Client Revenue % | 26.6% | 19.5% | 21.0% |
| Presales % | 49.6% | 32.0% | 35.7% |
| Internal % | 16.8% | 48.5% | 41.8% |
| Zero Output % | 7.0% | 0% | 1.5% |
| Avg Activities/Person | 363 | 131 | 192 |

**The structural pattern:** Contractors are presales-heavy (49.6%) while FTEs are internal-heavy (48.5%). FTEs build the platform; contractors build the pipeline. The question is whether this is by design or by drift.

## 2. Methodology & Definitions

**Methodology matches the Contractor Productivity Analysis** for direct comparability. Full MCP project refresh performed — every FTE activity is classified to a cost bucket. Zero unclassified.

| Term | Definition | Calculation |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Estimated Period Cost** | What the company paid this FTE for the period | Active Days x 8 hrs x $/hr |
| **Revenue Utilization Rate** | % of activities mapped to client (revenue-generating) projects | Client Activities / Total Activities |
| **Effective Hourly Rate** | What each hour of client work actually costs after dilution | $/hr / Revenue Utilization Rate |
| **Cost/Commit** | Cost per code commit — code output efficiency proxy | Period Cost / Commits |
| **Cost/Ticket** | Cost per completed ticket — throughput efficiency proxy | Period Cost / Tickets Completed |
| **Cost/Revenue Activity** | Cost per client-attributed activity — revenue efficiency | Period Cost / Client Activities |

**Cost Bucket Definitions** (same as Contractor Analysis):

| Bucket | What It Means | Projects |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| **Client (Revenue)** | Work that generates income | SIM Managed Services, SIM, TASC-Managed-Services, TASC, NUS-fin.-reporting-POC, nus-contract-generation, scientific-portfolio, Hypernative, Boardroom |
| **Presales (Cost of Sales)** | Investment in future revenue | All starter-pack-\*, starter-packs, Pre-Sales-Delivery, service-cloud-starter-pack-optimization |
| **Internal (Absorbed)** | Operational cost | manazer, exo-sf-core-agent, exo-code-server, exo-cli, exo-code-otel-service, exo-agent-builder, exo-help, harvester, New-Website, content-branding |

**FTE Identification:** The 9 contractors identified in the Contractor Productivity Analysis (Prabhat Ranjan, Rakesh Poddar, Bharat, Ganesh Hegde, Shantanu, Nikhil Galagali, Paharlaya Basnet, Manas, Animesh) are excluded. System accounts (It-admin, Exo) excluded from the main analysis and noted separately.

## 5. Cost Tier Analysis

**What this table shows:** FTE spend and output aggregated by cost rate tier. Higher-cost tiers should theoretically deliver higher-value output.

| Tier | Rate | Count | Total Est. Spend | Avg Activities | Avg Commits | Client $ | Client % | Presales $ | Internal $ |
|------|------|------:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Tier 1 | $120/hr | 1 | $7,680 | 43 | 29 | $0 | 0% | $7,680 | $0 |
| Tier 2 | $80/hr | 9 | $54,800 | 88 | 14 | $10,935 | 20% | $13,722 | $30,143 |
| Tier 3 | $50/hr | 7 | $30,400 | 216 | 58 | $5,592 | 18% | $7,907 | $16,901 |
| Tier 4 | $30/hr | 8 | $11,280 | 206 | 78 | $3,772 | 33% | $4,066 | $3,443 |
| **Total** | | **25** | **$104,160** | **131** | **38** | **$20,299** | **19%** | **$33,375** | **$50,487** |

**The inversion problem persists:** The lowest-cost tier ($30/hr) has the highest client revenue rate (33%) AND the highest average output (206 activities, 78 commits per person). The $80/hr tier spends 55% on internal ($30,143) — more internal $ than the other 3 tiers combined ($20,344). The $120/hr tier is 100% presales.

## 6. Revenue Efficiency Metrics

**What this table shows:** Cost-per-output metrics for FTEs with meaningful activity. Lower = more efficient.

| FTE | Rate | Commits | Tickets Done | Client Acts. | Cost/Commit | Cost/Ticket | Cost/Rev. Act. |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Isaac | $30 | 169 | 12 | 323 | $18.46 | $260.00 | $9.66 |
| Asarar Ahmed | $30 | 165 | 3 | 0 | $21.82 | $1,200.00 | N/A |

| Rohit T | $30 | 36 | 1 | 0 | $66.67 | $2,400.00 | N/A |
| Saurabh | $30 | 32 | 5 | 0 | $75.00 | $480.00 | N/A |
| Paulomi | $120 | 29 | 1 | 0 | $264.83 | $7,680.00 | N/A |
| Jewel James | $80 | 25 | 5 | 27 | $409.60 | $2,048.00 | $379.26 |
| Karthik | $80 | 23 | 5 | 0 | $333.91 | $1,536.00 | N/A |
| Priyanshu Gaur | $50 | 15 | 12 | 2 | $400.00 | $500.00 | $3,000.00 |
| Sidu | $80 | 7 | 7 | 28 | $1,188.57 | $1,188.57 | $297.14 |
| Srini | $80 | 3 | 3 | 6 | $2,346.67 | $2,346.67 | $1,173.33 |

**Benchmark comparison (from Contractor Analysis):**

| Metric | Best Contractor | Best FTE | Contractor Avg | FTE Avg (top 15) |
|--------|----------------|----------|---------------|---------|
| Cost/Commit | $20.24 (Nikhil) | $18.46 (Isaac) | $32.00 | $367.00 |
| Cost/Ticket | $45.57 (Rakesh) | $224.00 (Saurav) | $639.00 | $1,356.00 |

Isaac outperforms every contractor. The FTE average is dragged down by high-rate, low-output contributors.

| manazer | Internal | 109 | 50.7% |
| starter-pack-fsc-wealth-management-cloud | Presales | 37 | 17.2% |
| Pre-Sales-Delivery | Presales | 15 | 7.0% |
| scientific-portfolio | Client | 14 | 6.5% |

| Hypernative | Client | 1 | 0.5% |

**Cost to Company**

| Bucket | Cost | % |
|--------|---:|---:|
| Client (Revenue) | $1,288 | 13% |
| Presales | $2,907 | 28% |
| Internal | $6,045 | 59% |

**Assessment:** The most expensive FTE, spread across 13 projects — the widest spread of anyone. 59% internal ($6,045) dominated by manazer platform. Some client revenue ($1,288 from scientific-portfolio, NUS, TASC, Hypernative) and presales investment ($2,907 from starter-packs). The 13-project spread suggests a cross-functional coordination role, not a focused delivery role. At $409.60/commit and $2,048/ticket, measurable output efficiency is low. The question: is the value in cross-project oversight that enables others, or is this an $80/hr resource spread too thin?

### 7.2 Geetha (Delivery Head) — $8,960

**Activity Summary**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Activities | 212 |
| Active Days | 14 of 15 |

| starter-pack-fsc-insurance-cloud | Presales | 2.8% |
| Hypernative | Client | 2 | 0.9% |
| SIM | Client | 2 | 0.9% |
| scientific-portfolio | Client | 1 | 0.5% |

**Cost to Company**

| Bucket | Cost | % |
|--------|---:|---:|
| Client (Revenue) | $2,198 | 25% |
| Presales | $6,254 | 70% |
| Internal | $508 | 6% |

**Assessment:** The MCP refresh transforms the Geetha picture. She is the **top presales investor** among FTEs — $6,254 (70%) across 6 presales projects. She also has meaningful client revenue ($2,198, 25%) from TASC, SIM, Hypernative, and scientific-portfolio. Only 6% internal. Spread across 12 projects — consistent with a Delivery Head managing multiple workstreams. 17 tickets completed (best among $80/hr FTEs). Her effective hourly rate for client work is $326.15, but her presales management likely enables the entire starter-pack pipeline. This role is correctly deployed — the value is in pipeline orchestration, not individual output.

**Cost to Company**

| Bucket | Cost | % |
|--------|---:|---:|
| Client (Revenue) | $1,750 | 21% |
| Presales | $3,128 | 38% |
| Internal | $3,442 | 41% |

**Assessment:** Spread across 16 projects — the widest of any contributor in the entire organization. The Tech Lead role explains this: oversight across the full portfolio. 21% client, 38% presales, 41% internal is a balanced allocation for a technical leader. Only 7 commits reflects a coordination role, not a hands-on coding role. Client revenue ($1,750) from scientific-portfolio, SIM, and NUS demonstrates involvement in revenue work. The internal 41% is split across 6 different internal projects — broad technical oversight. This profile is consistent with an engaged Tech Lead managing the full platform. At $8,320/period, the value depends on whether this breadth of oversight is enabling team productivity.

**Cost to Company**

| Bucket | Cost | % |
|--------|---:|---:|
| Client (Revenue) | $0 | 0% |
| Presales | $7,680 | 100% |
| Internal | $0 | 0% |

**Assessment:** 100% Pre-Sales-Delivery. The most expensive hourly rate ($120/hr) in the organization, fully deployed on presales. 29 commits in 43 activities (67% commit ratio) shows hands-on technical presales work, not just management. 8 of 15 active days (53% capture rate) is the lowest among significant FTEs. At $7,680/period ($200K annualized) of pure presales investment, the return depends entirely on Pre-Sales-Delivery pipeline conversion. If she's building demos/POCs that close deals, this is justified. If not, this is the most expensive non-revenue role in the organization.

|--------|---:|---:|
| Client (Revenue) | $0 | 0% |
| Presales | $1,133 | 15% |
| Internal | $6,547 | 85% |

**Assessment:** 85% internal with zero client revenue. At $80/hr, $6,547/period ($170K annualized) on internal tooling. The 15% presales (service-cloud-starter-pack-optimization) provides some pipeline value. The manazer + exo-help combination suggests a platform support/development role. Cost/commit of $333.91 is expensive for internal work. An $80/hr FTE on internal tooling is a strategic staffing question — same as contractors Manas and Shantanu at $30/hr.

**Cost to Company**

|--------|---:|---:|
| Client (Revenue) | $464 | 7% |
| Presales | $310 | 4% |
| Internal | $6,266 | 89% |

**Assessment:** 89% internal dominated by manazer (75%). Spread across 11 projects but with negligible involvement in most. Only 3 commits and 3 tickets in 11 active days — the lowest measurable output of any FTE with significant cost. At $2,346.67/commit, by far the most expensive code output. The small touches across client projects (scientific-portfolio, TASC, SIM — 6 activities total) suggest advisory/oversight, not delivery. At $80/hr and 89% internal, this is $6,266/period ($163K annualized) of absorbed platform cost with minimal measurable output. The role may deliver value through architecture, mentoring, or decisions not captured by Manazer — but the data doesn't show it.

| Presales | $3,191 | 53% |
| Internal | $2,745 | 46% |

**Assessment:** Present every business day. Good ticket throughput (12 completed, 0.8/day). 53% presales across Pre-Sales-Delivery and starter-pack-manufacturing — meaningful pipeline investment. 46% internal on exo-agent-builder platform. Low commit count (15) relative to high activity (188) — a ticket/configuration worker, not a code-heavy one. The 53/46 presales/internal split at $50/hr is a reasonable allocation — half building pipeline, half building platform.

**Assessment:** Highest-output FTE — 359 activities, 118 commits, 25 tickets completed. Best ticket throughput of any FTE (1.8/day). Clean 3-project allocation. 25% client revenue from TASC ($1,404) and 17% presales. The 58% internal on exo-sf-core-agent is the core platform investment. At $50/hr, a strong performer. If rebalanced even partially from internal to client work, could significantly increase revenue contribution.

| Internal | $4,485 | 86% |

**Assessment:** 86% internal across 5 internal platform projects. The 13% presales (service-cloud-starter-pack-optimization) provides some pipeline value. Decent commit velocity (4.8/day) and consistent presence (13/15 days). At $50/hr, $4,485/period ($117K annualized) of internal platform cost. Weekend activity recorded. A core platform engineer — the value depends on whether the exo-\* platform suite is strategic.

**Assessment:** 55% client revenue — the 3rd highest revenue utilization among FTEs with significant volume. Zero commits but 82 activities and 6 tickets created suggests a project management/oversight role on NUS projects. The 45% internal (harvester + exo-code-server) is a secondary allocation. At $80/hr with 55% client deployment, the effective hourly rate for client work is $145.72 — the best among $80/hr FTEs. 8 active days out of 15 is low — could indicate part-time or role-based limitations.

**Assessment:** The model FTE. 89% client revenue from scientific-portfolio. Highest commits/active day in the entire organization (13.4/day). Despite 6 leave days, produced 408 activities in 10 days. Data conflict: activity recorded on leave day Feb 4 (64 activities per verification). Effective hourly rate = $56.05 — the best among $50/hr FTEs. At $4,000/period, this is the most cost-efficient revenue-generating FTE in the roster.

**Assessment:** Zero client revenue — 53% presales, 47% internal. 15 active days despite 4 leave days — the most extreme leave/activity conflict, confirmed working weekends (Feb 1, 8, 14, 15). Second highest FTE commit count (165). Only 3 tickets completed in 15 days — severe commit-to-ticket ratio of 55:1. At $30/hr, cost is low. The New-Website allocation (56 activities, $561) is a notable internal investment from a $30/hr resource. Workload and leave compliance warrant review.

**Notable findings from MCP refresh:**
- **Paulomi** ($120/hr): 100% Pre-Sales-Delivery — pure presales investment, not unaccounted
- **Rishi** ($80/hr): 100% Boardroom (Client) — all 4 activities are revenue work
- **Kaathyayani** ($30/hr): 74% presales, 26% client — a presales PM contributing to revenue (TASC)
- **Das Animesh** ($30/hr): 72% presales, 23% client — mostly Pre-Sales-Delivery with some client work
- **Rajnish, Suraj, Piyush Sinha, Jeetal Shah**: 100% internal with minimal output — management roles or effectively absent

| **TOTAL** | | | **663** | **~$26,750** |

**$26,750/period ($695K annualized)** on manazer platform alone, across 18 contributors.

### All Internal Platforms

| Platform | Contributors | Est. Cost |
|----------|-------------|---:|
| manazer | 18 | ~$26,750 |
| exo-sf-core-agent | 5 | ~$8,573 |
| exo-code-server | 8 | ~$5,800 |
| exo-agent-builder | 5 | ~$3,100 |

## 10. Action Items

### For CEO / Paulomi

**A. Presales Pipeline ROI Review**

FTEs invest $33,375/period ($867K annualized) in presales. Key presales investors:

| FTE | Presales $ | Presales % | Key Projects |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Paulomi | $7,680 | 100% | Pre-Sales-Delivery |
| Geetha | $6,254 | 70% | 6 starter-pack projects |
| Priyanshu Gaur | $3,191 | 53% | Pre-Sales-Delivery + mfg |
| Sidu | $3,128 | 38% | 6 presales projects |
| Jewel James | $2,907 | 28% | 3 starter-pack projects |
| Megha Bc | $2,709 | 87% | 2 starter-pack projects |

Combined with contractor presales ($13,698), total presales investment is **$47,073/period ($1.22M annualized)**.

**Action:** Map presales projects to pipeline value. Which starter-packs have active prospects? What is the expected revenue conversion? $1.22M/year of presales investment requires at minimum $2-3M in expected pipeline to justify.

---

### For Geetha (Delivery Head)

**B. $80/hr Tier Internal Allocation Review**

The $80/hr tier has $30,143/period ($784K annualized) on internal projects:

| FTE | Internal $ | Internal % | Primary Internal Project |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Karthik | $6,547 | 85% | manazer + exo-help |
| Srini | $6,266 | 89% | manazer |
| Jewel James | $6,045 | 59% | manazer + 5 others |
| Sidu | $3,442 | 41% | 6 internal projects |
| Anirudh | $2,310 | 45% | harvester + exo-code-server |
| Rajnish | $1,920 | 100% | manazer + exo-code-server |
| Rishi | $0 | 0% | (100% client) |
| Geetha | $508 | 6% | manazer |
| Jeetal Shah | $640 | 100% | manazer |

**Action:** Three $80/hr FTEs (Karthik, Srini, Jewel James) account for $18,858/period ($490K annualized) of internal spend. Determine if this is the right staffing tier for internal platform work. Could $30-50/hr resources handle manazer development? Should $80/hr FTEs be redirected to client delivery where their effective hourly rate matters?

**C. Low-Activity FTE Audit**

Five FTEs have <10 activities with a combined cost of $8,080:

| FTE | Rate | Activities | Cost | Pattern |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Rajnish | $80 | 10 | $1,920 | 100% internal, 3 active days |
| Sumanth | $50 | 9 | $1,600 | 100% internal (New-Website) |
| Rishi | $80 | 4 | $1,920 | 100% client (Boardroom) |
| Piyush Sinha | $30 | 2 | $240 | 100% internal, 1 active day |
| Jeetal Shah | $80 | 2 | $640 | 100% internal, 1 active day |

**Action:** For each, determine if they are part-time, on extended leave, in roles not captured by Manazer, or underperforming. Rishi is the exception — 100% client work but only 4 activities suggests a senior/advisory role on Boardroom.

**D. Ticket Completion Discipline**

Same pattern as contractors — high commits, low ticket completions:

| FTE | Commits | Tickets Done | Ratio |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Asarar Ahmed | 165 | 3 | 55:1 |
| Rohit T | 36 | 1 | 36:1 |
| Megha Bc | 79 | 6 | 13:1 |
| Isaac | 169 | 12 | 14:1 |

Compare to Saurav Shah (118:25 = 4.7:1) and Geetha (46:17 = 2.7:1).

**Action:** Audit ClickUp workflow for high-commit/low-ticket FTEs.

---

### For Sidu (Tech Lead)

**E. Leave-Day Activity Conflicts**

| FTE | Active Days | Leave Days | Available Days | Conflict |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Asarar Ahmed | 15 | 4 | 11 | +4 extra days (weekends) |
| Akhil | 10 | 6 | 9 | 64 activities on leave day |
| Saurav Shah | 14 | 3 | 12 | +2 extra days |

**Action:** Investigate whether leave records are inaccurate or FTEs are working during leave. Compliance and burnout risk.

**F. Manazer Platform Staffing Right-Sizing**

18 contributors touched manazer this period. The core active team is ~7 (>10 activities each), costing ~$20,000+/period. 11 contributors had <10 manazer activities — incidental involvement.

**Action:** Define a core manazer team with intentional allocation. Reduce incidental drive-by contributions that dilute focus without advancing the platform meaningfully.

---

## 11. System Accounts (Excluded from Analysis)

| Account | Activities | Active Days | Cost | Key Project |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Exo | 38 | 7 | $1,680 | service-cloud-starter-pack-optimization (63%), exo-cli (37%) |
| It-admin | 39 | 3 | $720 | manazer (39%), scientific-portfolio (18%), SIM (10%), 8 others |

$2,400/period of system account cost. It-admin's spread across 11 projects suggests automated ingestion, not human activity.

---

## 12. Data Caveats

1. **Activity does not equal hours.** Same as contractor analysis — Manazer counts events, not time. A 4-hour architecture review and a 30-second ticket comment both count as 1 activity. This disproportionately undervalues leadership/management roles.

2. **FTE cost underestimated.** Active Days methodology underestimates true FTE cost because FTEs are salaried regardless of Manazer activity. An FTE with 8 active days is paid for all 15 (minus leave), not 8. The "ghost cost" — paid but untracked days — is not captured.

3. **PR data excluded.** Same 446-PR data gap. Code review and merge activity invisible for all contributors.

4. **Cost rates may be billing, not compensation.** The $30-$120/hr tiers may represent billing rates, internal cost, or compensation — affects all calculations.

5. **Role context missing.** No role/title field in Manazer. $80/hr FTEs may be managers, architects, or senior ICs — their value isn't captured by activity counts.

6. **Project tagging is clean.** Full MCP refresh confirmed: every FTE activity maps to a project. Zero nil-project activities. All percentages are based on complete data.
