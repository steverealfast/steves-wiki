**Cost reconciliation**: Project-level costs ($30,771 + $41,392 + $43,347 = $115,510) cover work-session hours allocated to named projects. The remaining $155,074 is: (1) meeting hours classified to buckets but not individual projects, (2) noise hours allocated to Internal but not specific projects, (3) cost for unclassified sessions. Org-level allocation ($270,584) is authoritative.

## Concerns (v2 — CFO-validated thresholds, Feb 23 2026)

### Genuine Concerns — Action Required

**Contractors below 25% client allocation (Geetha to transition):**

| Name | Type | Cost | Hrs | Client% | Verified | Noise | Noise% | Flags |
|------|------|-----:|----:|--------:|---------:|------:|-------:|-------|
| Rakesh Poddar | CON | $9,120 | 277.5 | 24.1% | 55.7 | 64.5 | 40% | CON_LOW_CLIENT HIGH_NOISE(40%) |
| Bharat | CON | $8,880 | 309.8 | 19.3% | 163.4 | 40.3 | 18% | CON_LOW_CLIENT |
| Nikhil Galagali | CON | $8,640 | 276.3 | 16.2% | 190.5 | 9.6 | 4% | CON_LOW_CLIENT |
| Paharlaya Basnet | CON | $8,640 | 238.5 | 0.0% | 171.8 | 11.0 | 6% | CON_LOW_CLIENT ZERO_CLIENT |
| Shantanu | CON | $8,640 | 186.8 | 18.2% | 83.5 | 14.8 | 13% | CON_LOW_CLIENT |

**FTEs not deployed on client work:**

| Name | Type | Cost | Hrs | Client% | Issue |
|------|------|-----:|----:|--------:|-------|
| Karthik | FTE | $11,084 | 167.7 | 17.2% | $36.46/hr, HIGH_NOISE(33%), expensive resource not on client work |
| Priyanshu Gaur | FTE | $4,432 | 232.4 | 0.0% | ZERO_CLIENT, HIGH_NOISE(44%), coordinator role needs client deployment |

**Total cost at risk: $59,436 (22% of $270,584 total spend)**

### Explained by Role (not actionable)

| Name | Flags | Role / Explanation |
|------|-------|--------------------|
| Rajnish | HIGH_NOISE(100%) LOW_VERIFIED | Reviewer — zero commits, 100% noise expected |
| Srini | HIGH_NOISE(84%) LOW_VERIFIED | Reviewer — same pattern |
| Jewel James | ZERO_CLIENT HIGH_NOISE(31%) | Data scientist — internal by design |
| Manas | CON_LOW_CLIENT | Designer — internal platform work by design |
| Anirudh | HIGH_NOISE(36%) LOW_VERIFIED | NUS + internal platform, outstanding performer — role explains pattern |
| Rohit T | ZERO_CLIENT | New hire / support — ramping |
| Asarar Ahmed | ZERO_CLIENT | $952 total cost, 203.8 verified hrs — highly productive at $3.13/hr |

### Concern Flag Definitions

| Flag | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| CON_LOW_CLIENT | Contractor with < 25% client allocation — should be on client projects |
| ZERO_CLIENT | 0% client allocation |
| GHOST_COST | Active fewer than 20% of business days |
| HIGH_NOISE(X%) | Noise > 30% of non-meeting hours — prompt CFO for reviewer identification |
| LOW_VERIFIED | Zero verified hours despite > 50 total hours — prompt CFO for reviewer identification |

## Action Items

### 1. Transition Contractors to Client Projects

| Contractor | Current Client % | YTD Cost | Verified Hrs | Current Focus |
|------------|----------------:|--------:|---------:|---------------|
| Rakesh Poddar | 24.1% | $9,120 | 55.7 | Presales 23% + Internal 53% |
| Bharat | 19.3% | $8,880 | 163.4 | Presales 41% + Internal 40% |

| Shantanu | 18.2% | $8,640 | 83.5 | Presales 23% + Internal 59% |

**Owner**: Geetha | **Deadline**: End of March 2026 | **Target**: >=50% client allocation by April
**Impact**: ~$20K/month shifted from internal/presales to client revenue work

### 2. FTE Deployment Review

- **Karthik** ($36.46/hr, 17.2% client, $11,084) — expensive resource, 78% internal
- **Priyanshu Gaur** ($14.58/hr, 0.0% client, $4,432) — zero client, coordinator role

**Owner**: Geetha + Steve | **Review**: March 2026

### 3. Q2 Target Setting

**Owner**: Steve | **Due**: April 1, 2026
Define allocation targets for Q2 (e.g., 30% Client, 25% Presales, 45% Internal). Dashboard will switch from month-over-month comparison to target-based tracking.

- exo-help: classified as Client but is a reusable asset — track separately for amortization

- Known internal-by-design: Jewel James (data science), Manas (designer), Rohit T (new/support), Anirudh (NUS/platform)
- Q2 2026 roadmap: Replace previous-month comparison with target-based comparison
