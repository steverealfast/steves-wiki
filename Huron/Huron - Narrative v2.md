# **Huron — Senior Leadership Narrative**

## **Our Thesis**

We believe IT services is entering a structural shift that most firms haven't fully reckoned with yet. This is our hypothesis — not an industry consensus:

- Revenue per employee across the major IT services firms appears to have been flat for 7+ years. For every additional million in revenue, firms seem to be adding 20-30 employees. We don't think this ratio has meaningfully moved.
- Deal sizes and durations seem to be compressing. The era of $100M, 10-year contracts is giving way to a barbell — more frequent, smaller deals alongside fewer large ones.
- The economics that worked for large, long-duration contracts break when you have to constantly sell, scope, deliver, and re-sell. The friction per unit of revenue is too high.
- Traditionally, IT services firms could absorb the cost of time overruns and delivery slippage through large bench strength — idle capacity that acted as a buffer. As cost pressures have intensified, firms have been forced to cut bench. That safety net is gone. Every project now has to land closer to its estimated time-to-value, with less room for error and fewer spare resources to throw at problems when they slip.
- Giving delivery teams AI tools alone doesn't fix this. It clears the bottleneck at one end while pre-sales, scoping, consulting, and knowledge transfer remain manual. The constraint just moves upstream. AI adoption is an execution problem, not a procurement problem — buying tools doesn't change how work flows through an organization.

If we're right, the firms that break through won't be the ones that adopted AI tools. They'll be the ones that restructured how work flows through their entire organization — from first customer conversation through to delivery and beyond.

That's what we've built. And we think it's directly relevant to where Huron is headed.

## **Opening**

We know what you're thinking. You've seen decks and demos before. You've been down this road with vendors who promised AI transformation and delivered training programs that nobody used. Nothing we show you today on a screen will fully answer the question: does this actually work on real work?

So let's skip that part. **Give us a project. Something your team has scoped at six weeks. We'll deliver it in two. If we don't, we don't charge.**

That's not a sales pitch. That's a bet we're willing to make because we've already lived it. Everyone at Realfast uses AI in their daily work — not because we trained them, but because they can't do their jobs without it. This applies across pre-sales, delivery, ops, and recruitment. AI is embedded in how we work, not bolted on top of existing processes.

Software is our business tool, not our business model. The platform underneath — Exocortex — is the reason we can operate this way. But the value is in the outcomes, not the tooling. And the only way to validate that is to see it on your work, in your domain, against your baseline.

---

## **What We're Showing Today**

Exocortex is our operating system for knowledge work. It performs three core functions: extracting expertise from people, contracts, and past projects; maintaining that knowledge as your business evolves; and applying it across different workflows. The components you'll see today include Manazer for IT Services delivery, ExoWork for pre-sales acceleration, and other ops automation tools.

Every project we deliver makes the next one faster — Exocortex captures the domain knowledge, patterns, and institutional expertise from each engagement. That's a compounding advantage, not a one-time efficiency gain.

---

## **The Ask**

We're asking for one project with a 4-6 week delivery window. The ideal project would be analytics, knowledge aggregation, requirements gathering, impact analysis, or proposal work in the healthcare or life sciences domain. We'll own delivery end-to-end, and it should have high enough visibility for Rick to see the impact.

We're not asking to run training programs, conduct workshops on AI adoption, or embed in your existing workflows as observers. The commercial structure would be fixed scope with milestone-based delivery.

---

## **If This Works**

In the first month, we deliver the initial project and prove this isn't vaporware. You'll have a measurable delta — time, cost, quality — against how your team would have delivered the same work.

In month two, we take on a second project in a different domain to show this isn't vertical-specific. Same operating model, different problem, same structural advantage.

At that point, the conversation shifts. It's no longer about whether we can deliver. It's about what your revenue per employee looks like with this operating model embedded — and what it looks like at scale.

---

## **Closing**

Pick one problem and give it to us. Watch how we work. If we deliver something that changes your perspective on what's possible, we'll talk about what comes next. Let's just do the work.

## **Reference Talking Points**

**Revenue per employee transformation:** If our thesis is correct, IT services firms are stuck at flat revenue per employee. We believe AI transformation — applied across the full pipeline, not just delivery — can push that toward $350-400K. Not through headcount reduction, but margin expansion and deal velocity acceleration.

**Role elimination creates margin multiplication:** A consultant who used to need two developers to deliver can now deliver alone. No timezone complexity, no role dependencies, no coordination overhead. That's the structural change — not 10% efficiency gains, but 2-3x margin improvement on transformed teams.

**Expertise tokenization is the moat:** We extract institutional knowledge from people, contracts, and past projects. We structure it into Exocortex. Expert plus model is greater than expert alone. This becomes a compounding competitive advantage — and why your competitors must not get their hands on this capability.

**We've lived the adoption pain:** We know adoption is hard. That's why we don't start with training — we start with delivery that creates undeniable results. Then conviction drives adoption, not the other way around. This requires top-down mandate from leadership.

**Full-stack acceleration, not just delivery:** If our thesis holds, you can't profitably deliver smaller deals with the current model. AI in delivery alone creates upstream bottlenecks. You need acceleration across the entire flow: pre-sales, consulting, delivery, operations. That's what we've built.

**The hybrid model:** The traditional SaaS model is compressing — margins degrade as AI makes software easier to build and switch. But the inverse is also true: services firms that embed proprietary software into their operating layer become structurally different from competitors. We're not a software company. We're a services firm whose operating system gives us fundamentally different economics. That's the model we think works for Huron.

**The bench is gone:** IT services firms used to absorb delivery risk through bench strength — spare capacity to throw at overruns. Cost pressures have stripped that buffer away. Every project now needs to hit its time-to-value target with less margin for error. That makes the speed and precision of AI-embedded delivery not just a nice-to-have, but a structural necessity.
