# **Huron Meeting \- Friday**

## **Opening**

You've been burned before by vendors promising AI transformation that turned into useless training programs.

**We don't train people on AI tools. We deliver work using AI.** Give us a project, and we'll ship it fast with high quality. You decide if you want more after seeing the results.

**Everyone at realfast uses AI in their daily work** \- not because we trained them, but because they can't do their jobs without it. This applies across pre-sales, delivery, ops, and recruitment. AI is embedded in how we work, not bolted on top of existing processes.

## **What We're Showing Today**

Exocortex is our operating system for knowledge work. It performs three core functions: extracting expertise from people, contracts, and past projects; maintaining that knowledge as your business evolves; and applying it across different workflows. The components you'll see today include Manazer for IT Services delivery, ExoWork for pre-sales acceleration, and other ops automation tools.

## **The Ask**

We're asking for one project with a 4-6 week delivery window. The ideal project would be analytics, knowledge aggregation, requirements gathering, impact analysis, or proposal work in the healthcare or life sciences domain. We'll own delivery end-to-end, and it should have high enough visibility for Rick to see the impact.

We're not asking to run training programs, conduct workshops on AI adoption, or embed in your existing workflows as observers. The commercial structure would be fixed scope with milestone-based delivery.

## **If This Works**

In the first month, we deliver the initial project and prove this isn't vaporware. In month two, we take on a second project to show this works beyond one domain. At that point, we discuss licensing and announce a services partnership.

## **Closing**

Pick one problem and give it to us. Watch how we work. If we deliver something that changes your perspective on what's possible, we'll talk about what comes next. Let's just do the work.

## **Reference Talking Points**

**Revenue per employee transformation:** IT services firms are stuck at flat revenue per employee for 7+ years. With AI transformation, you can almost double it. That's not through headcount reduction \- but margin expansion and deal velocity acceleration.

**Role elimination creates margin multiplication:** A consultant who used to need two developers to deliver can now deliver alone. No timezone complexity, no role dependencies, no coordination overhead. That's the structural change \- not 10% efficiency gains, but 2-3x margin improvement on transformed teams.

**Expertise tokenization is the moat:** We extract your institutional knowledge from people, contracts, and past projects. We tokenize it into Exocortex. Expert plus model is greater than expert alone. This becomes your competitive advantage \- and why your competitors must not get their hands on this capability.

**We've lived the adoption pain:** We know adoption is hard. That's why we don't start with training \- we start with delivery that creates undeniable results. Then conviction drives adoption, not the other way around. This requires top-down mandate from leadership.

**Full-stack acceleration, not just delivery:** The problem facing IT services is that you can't profitably deliver smaller deals. AI in delivery alone creates upstream bottlenecks. You need acceleration across the entire flow: pre-sales, consulting, delivery, operations.
