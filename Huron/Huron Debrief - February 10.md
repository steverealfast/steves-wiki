[@0:00](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=0.0) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

I'm in a house with two doctors. So I came in clothes that were contaminated by the train's air. And now there's a one year old kid.

So they're like, go change before you touch the baby and like, yeah, makes sense.

[@0:17](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=17.84) \- **Steven Sule**

How is that not a normal thought process in your world, bro?

[@0:22](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=22.66) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

It doesn't need to be yet. Hey, the party started already. Has it?

[@0:32](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=32.16) \- **Steven Sule**

It's all about stock value appreciation.

[@0:34](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=34.76) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

Stock pricing.

[@0:36](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=36.42) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

Stock value appreciation as a service.

[@0:40](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=40.86) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

I will appreciate your stock price. It looks good.

[@0:52](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=52.76) \- **Steven Sule**

Where is our fearless leader? Steward, our guide in the darkness.

[@1:03](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=63.84) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

So Vinay was alone in Bombay with EQT?

**ACTION ITEM: Send EQT deck to Rishi and Vinay \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=63.9999)**

[@1:07](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=67.66) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

No, he couldn't make it, he also fell sick. no.

[@1:12](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=72.1) \- **Steven Sule**

So EQT got actually pushed out. I have a deck to Dishi, I'm sending you and Vinay like today on EQT.

Okay, you can then work on it and do what magic needs to be done. So next week's call you get roped in as well.

Good morning, buddy. Hello, Ghanu. Hello, Ghanu. Is it?

[@1:43](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=103.74) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

I didn't know that. We don't talk about it.

[@1:46](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=106.26) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

Nothing. We just ignore it. We don't think about it. We don't look at it in the face. Nothing.

[@1:54](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=114.06) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

Next four, five months. Oh, he said it.

[@1:57](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=117.92) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

I don't know. I have no idea what

[@2:00](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=120.8) \- **Steven Sule**

Yeah, he's busy watching Winter Olympics.

[@2:07](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=127.3) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

It is a stress of ACL injuries. That's what I like about it.

[@2:13](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=133.46) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

My wife asked me that if somebody wins a gold medal at Winter Olympics, do they introduce themselves as an Olympian gold winner or a Winter Olympics gold winner?

And I was like, a big win on a bit.

[@2:28](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=148.14) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

Cold winner\! Hi, we are just waiting for Siddhi.

[@2:38](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=158.8) \- **Steven Sule**

I'll give you guys context on what my meeting was, what I think is happening and it requires a little bit of PR dust.

[@2:50](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=170.88) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

It was an in-person meeting.

[@2:52](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=172.54) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

It was an in-person meeting.

[@2:53](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=173.9) \- **Steven Sule**

It was supposed to be just with me and Ravi, who is Geeta's Connect. Correct. But he messaged me yes this morning saying that do you mind if I bring in a couple of my other leaders and those leaders ended up being the global head of consulting for Huron and the ASEAN head for the region so the managing director of the region so weirdly that guy was Sujit's one down in Salesforce and so he had spoken to Sujit about us in the past or Sujit had spoken about us to him in the So he knew something about us that was positive.

In a nutshell basically the Rick who is the global head of consulting was basically like listen after what happened last week we're just trying to come to terms with what the hell is happening in our industry like in exactly those words he's like we're just trying to figure out what is going on and what how to actually navigate this.

So tell me about what you guys do. And how we do it. So I gave him the spiel about my two legendary co-founders and effectively how we started on our Salesforce as a wedge.

And now with the drop of what happened last week, it's kind of opened itself up to anything being available for automation and using AI as part of the embedded workflow.

We went back and forth over time and very clearly they want to engage with us in some kind of model.

I said, look, the easiest way to do this would be with us being a subcontractor to you on a project or a part of a project.

Simply just do a fixed bid fee and delivery, I mean, payment on milestones of deliverables so that we can show you how we work as a team independent of you.

And then if that is something that you enjoy or you see value in, then we can figure out a way of like either embedding within your workflows or whether you use some of our tooling.

see. Let's Let's I was like, can take that conversation down further down the line. He, Rick was like, look, listen, we've been down this rodeo before with somebody else where they said they will embed AI into all our workflows and basically it ended up being a massive consulting gig where they were running training programs for us, but it was very clear that they didn't even know how to use their own tooling.

So I said, look, we won't, I said, let's not even talk about that path as being as an option.

Let's just take an existing project you've got, an existing thing you want to work on, and we can create the leverage on the back of that particular model.

So they're very keen. We have a demo set up for Friday with them where they need to actually find, to actually see both XO and Manager, though Ravi has already seen Manager and Flick.

And so in that context, Sidhu wanted to rope you guys in. Sidin, from a ER slash marketing narrative as to like how we actually play this.

And Sidu's positioning is, I mean, ultimately they've taken a hit on their stock price in the last couple of weeks.

I think it's down 13, 14% just from last night. And so is there a way that we can be part of that story that moves the stock price in a way?

Or is there a partnership that we can evolve with them? They have digital capabilities across Salesforce. Salesforce is just a vertical.

think it counts for about maybe 15% of their top line. The rest of it is all digital consulting or just consulting across the board.

Healthcare is a big play for them. So, yeah. That's my debrief. Sidu, you want to give your thoughts on what you want to do with this and how you want to take it forward?

Hey, sorry.

[@6:56](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=416.28) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

Before that, Steve, some questions.

[@6:58](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=418.22) \- **Steven Sule**

Yes. You mentioned...

[@7:03](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=423.34) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

So when you told, okay, what did you tell them about us? Like, what do they think? Who do they think we are?

What is their impression of it?

[@7:10](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=430.4) \- **Steven Sule**

So I said that we do AI delivery on Salesforce. Specifically, we had to become an SI. So I gave them the unit testing history.

And I said, listen, but ultimately, we realized we had to take up entire chunks of the workflow across the board for us to see any kind of material uplift in using AI.

And so we became an SI and I gave him that whole spiel about like how we've been able to move some projects and we use AI as part of our...

Just one sec. I'll be right back.

[@7:35](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=455.66) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

You guys continue. Be right back. Just one minute. Apologies.

[@7:39](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=459.34) \- **Steven Sule**

So in that, I sort of said that like how we use AI as part of our delivery mechanism, specifically around how all of our devs and all of our delivery team uses AI as a means to expedite the process and to be able to keep context and to be able to keep the knowledge and to be able to keep all of the documentation in a central centralized system so that we have...

No loss of any of the workflows across the board. So that specifically now that the cloud drops have happened, we are finding that we are able to go in from a consulting angle, identify working with a client on a specific workflow or a specific series of workflows, picking up a small chunk from a POC perspective and simply like creating a workflow around it where the human being's time is now drastically reduced and they are able to concentrate on other things.

But at the same time, that becomes a land and expand motion for us. So that's who they think we are.

[@8:36](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=516.141) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

Okay, so actually full history, Salesforce specialization and now we are doing sort of Salesforce land and expand.

[@8:42](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=522.781) \- **Steven Sule**

And so what he also said is that, listen, what is your plan now? Are you thinking about Salesforce as just the wedge and then going to ServiceNow Workday?

I'm like, look, that was originally the plan. I think logically, if you had asked me this two months ago or a month ago, I would have been like, yes, next vertical would have been some version of ServiceNow know, or Workday or something along.

But I was like, quite frankly, the way that the technology is evolving, we are also evolving as we go, go about, about it.

It's just that now the world is our oyster and we can do different things at different times. I said, our key USP is the way that we are basically an AI services firm first, where everybody within our organization has AI embedded in their own personal workflows.

And that sort of extrapolates itself to the way we do delivery.

[@9:29](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=569.9) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

Okay, okay. Yeah, I think I don't have any questions. Yeah, so that's where we left off.

[@9:38](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=578.02) \- **Steven Sule**

Again, they want, they probed on like simply things like what would be a potential commercial model look like? Would you guys, and Rick actually, I got to point this out, he was very keen.

He's like, look, is it going to be that you take on the workflow yourself? Or is it going to be that our teams get embedded with yours to be able to deliver something?

I was like, look, that's a question for Sidu. Depends on what the size of the deal is and what it is, but he's like, I'd like to see how the sausage is made.

I'm like, me too.

[@10:09](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=609.641) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Sure.

[@10:12](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=612.841) \- **Steven Sule**

So, yeah, that was in a nutshell. It was supposed to be a 15-20 minute coffee. went on for an hour and a half.

And, yeah, they are keen for Friday's meeting to go through. He's got, I think, six people on the call with him for that Friday meeting.

Um, I don't really know what the call would Who all would be there?

[@10:36](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=636.961) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Bro, I don't know. I know Ravi will be there.

[@10:38](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=638.961) \- **Steven Sule**

I know some technical dudes of his who were supposed to be in that meeting that we were scheduled for Tuesday or whatever it was last week sometime at 6 a.m.

there was supposed to be a call. think Vinay Gita and Paolo Mi were going to front that.

[@10:51](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=651.481) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

Yeah, yeah, we were going to show the, yeah, there's some stupid startup I call it in there. What we showed to the AIs.

whole everybody will Mario巧. You got Like went I another show Thank you.

[@11:00](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=660.641) \- **Steven Sule**

It needs to be something beyond that right now, right? Because they want to see… What were the objections here?

So both Rick and Ravi were both very pro. Ravi, I think, has severe pressure from the CRM slash Salesforce perspective for which is why both manager and what you're able to do in terms of the starter pack, in terms of automations, is going to be interesting to him.

But like, very clearly, he's got some severe pressure that he's dealing with. Rick's got severe, like, dude, where's my business going pressure?

This is going to fall apart on my watch. The other guy was like, skeptical as , right? Vivek, who's the head of Asia.

His objection or his… Yeah, sorry.

[@11:49](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=709.381) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

I was like, are there any specific objections from the first two? Because you mentioned the last, this guy had objections, and then we'll come to him because he's a skeptic.

But the guys who weren't skeptics, Ravi and this dude.

[@12:00](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=720.001) \- **Steven Sule**

Were there any objections at all? Yeah. So Rick's first thing is like, dude, this is one of those things we've seen before where someone says that they have all of this tooling and automation part of their workflow and they come in and they embed the workflow for us.

But in reality, they don't know what it is that they're embedding and it's just a useless contract. Like there's no material uplift across the board for anything.

Like everyone has to then take time out of their operating day to learn something. And while you're learning it, you're realizing that the guy who's teaching it to you doesn't know what the they're teaching you because they're not doing any of this.

They're just coming and selling like tooling effectively, right? I said, look, we are different. We differentiate in the ways that AI workflows are part of our delivery process.

We don't even want to get into this conversation with you where we're going to come in and train you.

That's a different conversation for a different time. Give us the work. Make us deliver the workflow on your behalf.

If you like what you see, we go further and further down the rabbit hole. You don't like what you see, say, ta-ta, bye guy, thank you.

Ravie had no pushback. Ravie had like specific use case pushback. Like he's like, dude, on your website, it says that you've got, you know, use cases for various industries.

He's thinking about it like a product. I'm like, dude, no, there's no product. I was like, by DNA, we want product.

But I was like, dude, very categorically have said everyone is billable. There is no product. If a product gets extracted out of this in the long run, so be it.

For now, it's no product. Like, it doesn't work that way. So he's like, for a financial services firm in terms of recruitment gathering, is that something you guys could work with?

I'm like, yeah, 100% we can work with. Tell us what the scope is. We can do what we got to do.

Right.

[@13:45](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=825.781) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Yeah, I think the, the, the hirer and users as a service to prove to yourself that you're not safe.

Coil is an absolute logical first step. Because you want that conviction in them, right? That, oh, this works. Right.

[@13:57](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=837.541) \- **Steven Sule**

What are the objections to the other guy?

[@13:59](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=839.261) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

The skeptic.

[@14:00](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=840.002) \- **Steven Sule**

I mean, he was coming from, he's like, dude, if what you're saying is true, for example, on Salesforce, you can do a bunch of this stuff automated, why the aren't you doing it at zero cost and dropping the bottom out of the pricing?

So I was like, man, to be honest with you, we've been thinking about this left, right, and center. One of the learnings that we've got from the AEs is that speed or cost doesn't seem to matter.

They seem to have a bunch of their favorite SIs that they work with, and nothing disrupts them from taking that SI or going to that SI first, unless the SI has now upped their price as we have seen with Sky.

He's like, suddenly when Sky has moved mid-market and above, then there is a gap in the market for some new SI to come in and replace them.

But ultimately, we've offered things at dirt cheap prices. I gave him an example of saying that we were willing to go to the Philippines and do it for like less than a thousand bucks.

And it didn't seem to hit, whether it was the start, it was the pro-stirf or whatever that pro-starter pack or whatever that thing is.

Right, right. So it really seemed more... No, he's like, that seems a bit like a bit of a surprise.

I'm like, man, you can validate this with your guys. You can validate it with Vernon and all of the guys that you've had a history with.

But quite frankly, like, we don't know what it is that's sold. Like, for the longest time, the only differentiator we had was to be able to operate on agent force, because longevity there didn't make a difference to us.

So, like, I think we're going to do two things, right? The first thing is that we need to rework what this demo looks like on Friday.

It cannot be what the original form of this was going to be on last week. If they want to see XO and how XO is going to be delivering, or how our workflows have XO inbuilt in them.

Manager, you can show them again, again, because Ravi, as the business owner, was very keen and was very complex.

complementary towards what you showed him on Exo. I mean on Manager. And then I don't know what else is going to be part of that conversation.

don't think like, I mean, I was talking to Nikhil at deals just now. There's no need for a deck or anything, bro.

don't, they're not going to look at that and do anything with that, honestly.

[@16:20](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=980.102) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Also, I think the other part of it, which is, which has been skinny, is what I mentioned to you earlier, Steve, which is that it looks like the problem, the actual problem statement is, how do we ship a press in 60 days after engaging with us that elevates the share price?

That's all the actual problem statement. Which is also why I was going to say, I think we shouldn't even know this.

Because this is not, this is not just about actually solving the problem, we actually solve the problem in a, you know, obviously we can't buy the whole 2 billion dollar market cap.

Bro, you're cracking for me, Shidi. Yo, sorry, can you hear me? Sorry, sorry, I'm going to hear me. Can you hear me?

No?

[@17:04](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=1024.8) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

I mean, sorry, just to continue on that, Steve, you, Steve spoke to me about it, right? You didn't know how to frame it for other people?

[@17:12](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=1032.94) \- **Steven Sule**

Yeah, yeah. Ultimately, look, they've got multiple pressures, right? One is that they're a bit caught in the headlights. Hello?

[@17:22](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=1042.12) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Yeah, is this better? Yeah, better.

[@17:24](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=1044.52) \- **Steven Sule**

Yeah, sorry, please continue. I'll go after you two. No, so they're a bit caught in the headlights in terms of their business.

Like, they don't know which way it's going to go. And they're a bit nervous. I think that I didn't even think of it from a point of view of saying that as a PR sort of strategy for them to be able to say that they've partnered with someone that could potentially have an upswing on their share price.

Yeah, maybe that's, that's, that's, that's that's the gold standard. Um, but definitely they want to be able to see how this AI first process is going to work, right?

Right now, they're still stuck in the The old ways of doing things and they are actively looking for ways as to how that alpha can be materially created.

Whether it's in time saved, whether it's in quality implied or whether it's in speed of actually delivery, all of these things make a big difference.

And because a large chunk of their business is not Salesforce, the whole consulting led motion is kind of right up the alley, right?

They seem to understand it really well. So if there is a set of tooling that allows their consultants to be that distribution channel, I don't, I don't know if that, I mean, that, that's another potential, but immediately what I'm looking at is that if there is a way to get them a win in the short term, that does wonders for everyone.

[@18:43](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=1123.58) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

So just, just being thought about this, while we've anticipated this, I've done no thinking about what the moves, like how we would attack this problem, because I honestly didn't expect it to materialize this fast.

Now, there are two, two perspectives over here that I have. And all of this is me thinking off the top of my head.

One is the question that I asked earlier, which is that the only thing I can think of which has a shot at genuinely impacting them is to be able to say we picked this team.

It had x margin. We partnered with Realfast and ran AI transformation on that team. And now they are at 2x or 3x margin.

The only thing that I can think of.

[@19:27](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=1167.84) \- **Steven Sule**

Right? That's one. What you're saying in terms of timelines, right? I agree with the meta thesis of what you're saying.

But even in a 6-week sprint, hypothetically, right? Or 60-day sprint, or however you want to say it. How are you going to extrapolate that margin story for them?

Where, like, dude, if they are a public listed company, they cannot just be dhaping. I know, I know, which is why I'm saying that's the only thing I think of.

[@19:52](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=1192.06) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

And that is non-trivial. Sorry, let me step back a little bit. I'm just going back to our core thesis that

We are going to crunch down the timelines of delivery and that in itself is value to the customers. So it's a competitive advantage that we have.

It allows us to basically land and expand faster. This is what we are trying to do on NUS or Bojan Brothers.

This is one reality. The other reality is, in Salesforce for the US, now we are fairly confident. I mean, take it with a pinch of salt, but I'm just popular of this conversation too.

We are fairly confident that a consultant without having a developer is able to actually manage substantial efficiency, which means you are actually eliminating sales time queues, reducing the rate of delivery over there.

But not just three, two benefits. One, a role dependency goes away. That is a massive operational complexity that actually goes away.

Your time zone related complexities go away. And your profit margins also improve. two, six, seven, one, Thank Now, these are all the structural benefits that being AI first is delivering us.

Now, we don't know how it fits into their strategy. For example, someone might want to compete by passing on those margins to the customers because they want to acquire the market.

Or they want to actually show these margins to the shareholders to increase the share size. I don't know what they want to do with that.

did not meet any issues. But these are the capabilities that we have.

[@21:27](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=1287.96) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Yes, now, sorry, there is a, there is another open question to which we have not thought about the answer in this context, which is what do we want?

Like, how do we see this playing out? Like, what are we talking about here? Are we saying that our ideal is for Huron to start front-ending deals for us while we become their back-end?

Is that our strategy? Like, is that how we deliver excellent margins to them? Like, hey, you guys are a sales machine.

You leave delivery to us. Is that, is that the play? Or is the play that... They're going to say they're doing AI transformation for you.

So, you know, you are our customer and we will charge you X per month. What is our angle? What's the best?

What is the low, medium, high outcome for us? What are the three different things we would try? Which is low, medium, high outcome for us?

[@22:18](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=1338.24) \- **Steven Sule**

To be honest with you, if you go with the back office player here to say that they become a distribution node for us, you are going to face the same pushback that you're getting from the Salesforce channel, which is to say that for every dollar of revenue that you're getting from a customer, you have to share it with somebody else.

Now, I understand that in a lift and shift model that we had talked about with McKinsey partners or whatever that model is, it's similar, except that it's a different way of doing it because they're fronting for you.

Your brand is still front and center, whereas here your brand is always going to be Huron. So, I don't know whether that creates that alpha for us.

[@22:57](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=1377.08) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

It's to look still if you're going to give your Your. You're right about that, but I think there's one crucial difference in the Salesforce dynamic versus here, which is once we're in, we've proven this and we've taken over more than a few percent of their business, the power equation shifts.

We're no longer beholden to them. It's now the other way around. It's like either you pay us our fee, like we take our pound of flesh, or we walk, and then you figure this out.

Right, that has never been true in Salesforce. Sorry, can we just miss down?

[@23:31](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=1411.0) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

Guys, don't argue on the particular one. Can we just miss down the options first? Let's cover the bread, then we can look at things.

Sure, sure. Okay, so, hey Rishi, can you just please take notes? Sorry, I'm outside right now. But if you can share the screen, so that all the options are there, right?

I will go on this. Top of mind option for me is... is... Okay, sorry, I'm just testing the options.

Let me also simulate in the same trap. The revenue is good enough and the outcome of this, we are just looking at very tactically, we get revenue, right?

That's a very short term way of looking at it. The second way to look at it is, we are actually looking for a customer for our platform.

And the narrative is that, hey, we have gone and done AI transformation at Euron. My platform is sort of proven around certain verticals.

Now we go into the market to raise capital to go and buy our customers. And by the very fact that we have done this for Euron, we have a proof of concept that look, we are able to do this, right?

That's part of the other extreme end of it. Actually, even within Euron, right, there are actually two, three ways in which we can go.

One is, we provide them the team that we are the AI transformation people, because I'm assuming they don't have anyone who can.

We meaningfully do AI transformation, so even when we give them projects, either we can do the same type of projects, or we can do the NUS boardroom type of projects, if we do the NUS boardroom type of projects, that is the kind of institution, there is no way they can front a customer relationship, they might want to maintain brand or something, but it's going to be through and through our people, because we will not be able to deliver any other people, right, that's the whole point, relationship has to be the point of contact.

I mean, I mean, we share the place for that, but this is sort of the universe that I, is there, off the top of my mind, who else want to go next?

[@25:39](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=1539.56) \- **Steven Sule**

Yeah, I tend to agree with your, with your thing for like, the AI transformation, or the, the AI transformation, the sort of, we do an AI transformation on Huron itself, the issue there I feel is that, the timelines don't end up syncing, right, because, it's.

No, it's. No, It.

[@26:00](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=1560.0) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

It's not just the timeline, Steve, like the, the thing, the biggest concern with the AI transformation is they will have to bite the bullet to gut themselves.

I don't think anyone is going to bite that bullet. Yeah, no. I mean, just look at the pain we have internally, right?

[@26:13](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=1573.48) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

Maybe we have these conversations. Yeah, but it's not. Look, sorry, I'm just arguing this for the sake of arguing.

It's not a decision of gutting themselves. They need to run that POC on a team, realize the margins, and it's for them to decide what they want to do with them.

I don't think they are at a point where they are, they want to be blind. Like they clearly are now looking out because they are putting their head out of the sign.

So always, they don't have to say that.

[@26:42](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=1602.66) \- **Steven Sule**

What happens if you run a vertical first transformation on one of their verticals, right? As a proof point. Dude, it is going to be project based on the vertical.

[@26:52](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=1612.8) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

I'm like, bro, take a team. We will work. I mean, this is not immediate. Immediate we have to do delivery.

So yeah, so what are we talking about?

[@27:00](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=1620.84) \- **Steven Sule**

Delivery and then either team or vertical of AI transformation and this is where it's going to go a little bit.

[@27:06](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=1626.94) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

vertical will always be team-based because what you will do is you will go into one to two teams depending on how confident they are or how confident we are because it's not easy to do that.

You want to do the delivery, you then want to basically onboard their people, hand it off. It's effective. Actually, you know what?

This is like a build-up rate transfer sort of a thing with our platform included.

[@27:28](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=1648.52) \- **Steven Sule**

Okay, I'm just going to throw a complete boomerang in this one, which is to say at a $2 billion market cap, why does this not become something that we eventually subsume?

We subsume or they subsume us? We subsume. At $2 billion market cap. You prove a use case, right? You prove a particular vertical, you do all of the AI transformation for them.

Why does this not become an attractive PE shop kind of thing? it's...

[@28:02](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=1682.56) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Aakash and I had the exact same conversation. This is the slow capital pieces, right?

[@28:07](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=1687.9) \- **Steven Sule**

This is our chunk and our size that is going to attract a select few bunch of PEs that need that use case to be proved to them, right?

Just bear with me as I go down this talk. We have a parallel conversation happening with EQT. Okay, to be able to show how you do AI transformation on portfolio companies.

Preferably, you're going to go toe-to-toe with them on Perficent or whatever their AI transformation company that's currently on their books is.

If you're able to demonstrate an AI services-led motion on an existing consulting business and a chunky one, the capital, I mean, they're already churning out like north of 100 million profit a year.

That's their current profit margin. I mean, 10% in fact, I assume. I think they got about a billion dollars in sales.

They're getting it one and a half times top line. One, yeah, they had 1.5 bill, give or take. Right?

I mean, there's enough money there to like fund this. You're just needing the proof point that you can actually do something with it.

Like from a technology perspective, there's a whole operating layer that you will need to solve for simply with, more talent or additional kind of talent and capacity.

But I mean, if you're talking about a Hail Mary, you're talking about a ambitious target. I don't see what's more ambitious than this.

Yeah, I agree. How would we go from here to there though?

[@29:43](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=1783.5) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

That's the part where I need your insight. So you need, you need a financial sponsor.

[@29:47](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=1787.7) \- **Steven Sule**

You need somebody who has money to be able to back this. But you need a proof point for that financial sponsor, right?

What's a better proof point than working on their portfolio company? Simultaneously working on a company that is a large consultant.

Business that has ready-made customer acquisition and you're just modernizing their stack, you're modernizing their workflow.

[@30:07](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=1807.34) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

And I'm going back to our old argument, if we roll out the right observability platform here, we're essentially also qualifying them for a deal.

[@30:14](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=1814.98) \- **Steven Sule**

Yes, and you're going back to Rajan's slap in our face to say go get more bandwidth, why would you do five small deals, do one big deal?

[@30:23](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=1823.66) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Dude, but buying a $2 billion listed company, I don't know, bro, like, you tell me, like, do we have cojones big enough for that?

I mean, dude, you want ambition, right?

[@30:33](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=1833.72) \- **Steven Sule**

I mean, it's a step in the direction where you're saying that, I definitely have a problem with the Sidu's ambitions.

[@30:40](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=1840.5) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

He was just like, went into a different orbit. No, I'm saying it this way.

[@30:45](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=1845.2) \- **Steven Sule**

Look, there are multiple steps before you get there. But, no, no, I'm agreeing. I'm agreeing directionally. I mean, directionally what happens, either they buy you for some stupid price that you decide is okay, I will be okay to sell at this price.

I mean, let's just be honest, if it's a $2 billion company, on the top line, what are they going to say, like 100 mil, but there's no real revenue for us.

So you're talking about a 100x on like revenue that you're working with right now.

[@31:17](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=1877.84) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

Steve? Yeah? I'm trying to structure this and what do you guys do next? Okay. And if you look at the meeting you had, that day is, that day's biggest problem was the floor is falling, our share price has crashed and I think it's crashed like 15% in the last, what, three months or whatever it is, right?

9% in the last whatever. My thinking is, sorry, outside of perspective, so shoot me if I'm wrong. Let's assume you want to buy them.

Okay, Steve, forget. Forget about the mechanics there. The first step is, what can you do to convince them to buy you?

[@31:53](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=1913.86) \- **Steven Sule**

That's proof of point in terms of your platform layer of technology and the workflow that you're talking about. Without going into the details, my point is...

Pardon?

[@32:04](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=1924.8) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

I said interesting. You're basically saying you go to private equity with their offer to buy you and say, now we want to buy them.

But yes, but I'm saying we have a meeting on Friday.

[@32:13](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=1933.42) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

What are the next steps? My thinking is they want to shore up their share price. Their share price is not going to be showed up because they give a contract to a real first.

That is not going to change their share price. Their share price will change if hyperside, they're permanently transformed as a company.

So today, for example, what? They have 250k revenue per employee. They are saying that we've done something that now takes us to 350k revenue per employee.

Right? What we've done to do that is we've acquired this company that is going to completely re-engineer with the way we do deals from top of the funnel to delivery.

They have XO plus manager plus whatever it is. So what you want to prove if you want to convince the first guy is what do you do in the next 30 days or 60 days to convince them to buy you as a first step?

Because if they are not convinced to buy you, then you don't have the conviction to buy them. Am I being clear?

Yeah. Therefore, the messaging you want to go back to them is, we are not going to come back as a contractor.

Fine, that might be the paperwork, but we're going to fundamentally change you as a company. So this is not 5% margin more here, 10% margin more there.

Yes, that might be the path to a means to an end. But what you want Huron to say is that they should immediately go back thinking we need to buy real fast.

What do you do now in the next three stages where in stage four, they want to buy real fast?

This is how I would think about it. Or therefore, you know, there's a bunch of things happening on public tokens.

There's a bunch of things that Huron knows how to do. The gap is in between, which is they don't know how to bridge what's happening with LLMs to meet their competence right now, which is healthcare, whatever it is, right?

You guys need to go and say EXO plus manager plus real fast is the gap between those two things.

Am I making sense?

[@33:51](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2031.26) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Yep. Yes, you're right.

[@33:53](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2033.98) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

So then what do you want to go to them? Again, I'm saying stage by stage. Ultimately, what they want to know is you're currently, you guys are at 250\.

350K revenue per employee. Once we come in, in the next six months, we can get you to 350K, 400K.

Then you can announce an acquisition and your share price is going to go up by 20% because now you're a fundamentally new company.

You might acquire them later at that point, Steve, with your PE, Jigari Pokhari. But the fundamental message they need to understand is you're not a contractor, you're a potential company changing acquisition target.

All the messaging you do from this point onwards has to be that. Does that make sense? Cool.

[@34:27](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2067.96) \- **Steven Sule**

Yep. Yes. therefore, when you go to them on, again, please take this with a pinch of salt.

[@34:32](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2072.1) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

when you go to them on Friday, I want you guys to maybe think backwards and say, how do I get acquired by them in three months?

What do I do as a proof point? Proof point number one, one customer. Proof point number two, one vertical.

Proof number three, three verticals. Right. And this is not giving Huron guys dev in, which is what, I mean, I have a bigger pitch for this team, which we'll do this offline separately.

You're basically saying that from customer acquisition, through pitching, through delivery, through everything. Exo Manager plus the Realflast layer is going to accelerate the whole thing.

So tomorrow you can double your revenue without doubling your employees. And you cannot do that by hiring a consultant, you do that by building an entire layer of operations in the company.

That is real fast. Now how do you guys, in the next two deals, prove to them that is the case and then everything will happen after that.

What do you do next? Step 1 to prove this to them.

[@35:32](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2132.58) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

I think the first question I will have is in which vertical. We have two, three options over there. You need to pick something.

process is one.

[@35:41](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2141.15) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

Akash, again, as an outsider, I would think pick up something strategically important to Huron. No, no, I understand that.

[@35:48](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2148.57) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

The reason I'm going into these options is this is where we can even think about it. Then we need to figure out where it fits into their strategy, right?

But these are the only options. Otherwise, Huron's options are much more than mine. So the same process is one.

one. Uh, AI transformation of a client is another one and a legacy code migration, uh, is the third one.

These are the three where we have done zero to one. Correct.

[@36:13](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2173.63) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

Another way I would say also, if this helps is that you need to, you need to transform an existing client.

You need to help them accelerate potentially somebody in their funnel already. So you can prove both that I can help you convert somebody faster.

I can make the existing customer more profitable. That is also maybe another vector in which basically it's not just your raw delivery.

[@36:34](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2194.83) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

You're saying that I'll accelerate your deflow also, but that's also operations.

[@36:38](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2198.93) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

Sidu, again, this is the larger message I want to talk to you guys about, but that is the only way because what is happening with IT services companies is that they're suddenly getting very barbell shaped.

I've been talking to a bunch of guys in our, what's happening is, uh, your Infosys, is it okay if I digress for two minutes?

Yeah, yeah, please. If what's happening with your Infosys, TCS, Wipro, that is slowly coming out is number one, all of their revenue per employee has been

In some cases, flat for seven years. Very interesting. I think for each of these guys on average, every additional million dollars of revenue is 20 to 30 employees.

This has not changed, I think, for seven years or so. Secondly, if you looked at some of the notices, letters that Wipro and guys are putting out, two things are happening.

One is average deal sizes are coming down, average duration of deals are coming down. Deals are no longer 100 million deals for 10 years.

They are all slowly coming smaller and moving to the left. So suddenly, you are seeing these barbell-shaped deals where Infosys and Wipro have to manage a bunch of smaller deals, a shorter duration and a bunch of longer deals, which are all moving to the center or to my left.

You're right. Therefore, the problem they're having is they've always built a, the metric I'm calling is they've always built a high friction per unit of revenue model.

We will just throw people at it because it's a large deal. It'll last forever. We don't have to renegotiate every month or every year.

[@37:48](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2268.87) \- **Steven Sule**

This is fully changing.

[@37:50](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2270.11) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

All of these guys now have to negotiate more often. Their sales pipeline is much more crowded. Somebody has to do the paperwork constantly.

Giving dev in to an employee does not accelerate flow. Everybody in the company has to use AI if you want to accelerate flow.

Otherwise, you'll just end up creating a bottleneck on top of the funnel without clearing, you know, you've cleared up the bottleneck at the end.

Developers are pushing code faster, but deals are still stuck because your deal flows were designed for 10 years ago.

Right? This is also going to happen to Huron as well, which means, therefore, the reason why XO Manager makes a compelling messaging for me at this stage is that you're saying I will accelerate the entire deal flow from the day you talk to a customer first to deliver.

Which is exactly our argument to them.

[@38:30](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2310.09) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

It's like, you don't worry about which vertical, which per day. You bring those in on the sales group, let's accelerate your deals for you.

Exactly. Exactly.

[@38:37](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2317.27) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

So we're accelerating the whole pipeline for you, not just the code writing. Right? This is important for them because Huron cannot, can no longer go and say, you're going to keep growing at 250k USD per employee.

That is unacceptable with AI around the corner. It has to become 300, 350, 400, whatever it is. To do that.

To do that, that, it's not enough for you, it's only a delivery. Sorry, carry on. Yeah, yeah.

[@39:01](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2341.59) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

No, no, I was just saying that, sorry, Aakash, your exo work demo coincidentally while it's on pre-sales is directly relevant to this line of attack, right?

[@39:10](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2350.59) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

It's basically, for example, if Rishi and I work on this, because look, fundamentally, Rishi has been front and center of, actually both Rishi and Vinay, right, of how to use AI for faster sales closing.

There is a, there are like both in terms of the value prop to the customer as well as the internal processes.

We have certain opinions. If we are able to convert that into a demo, we basically have a very, I mean, yes, we can fundamentally make the argument, provide them examples and showcase something at the same time saying that how does the sales get accelerated?

[@39:53](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2393.31) \- **Steven Sule**

Dude, how does this tie into what Sidin was saying, right? think simply from a proof point perspective for. Or step 1, 3\.

I'm just trying to tie that all in together, right? Because... Sorry, Steve.

[@40:06](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2406.21) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

The one final point I want to make is, therefore, the broader messaging I'm thinking in terms of real fast, sorry, again, slight digression, is it's no longer enough for an IT services company to be profitable at $30 million deals.

You need to be profitable at $30k, $300k, $3 million, $30 million, $300 million. This is now going to be the big challenge for IT services companies going forward.

Because if you talk to any of these guys, they hate doing upselling deals on a $30 million deal because they cannot do a million dollar deal profitable.

They're just not designed to do it. This is not going to change. And you're increasingly seeing people like Snowflake saying, can we just hive off these smaller deals to somebody else?

Because we cannot profitably deliver a $300k extra add-on or whatever. But yeah, coming back to what I was saying is, if that is the end goal, how do you break it down?

Like, what do you do next and then next and then next for Huron to get convinced that I can accelerate the whole flow for you?

Maybe one deal, one new deal, one vertical. I don't know, but that's how I would break it up.

[@41:07](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2467.39) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

No, I think the one deal as a first starting point, see new deal is probably going to be unlikely unless they have something immediately in their works to give to us like, hey, is there something you're struggling with to convert?

It doesn't seem like the first thing that they would want to introduce a new partner to. So I think the likelihood of going with an existing deal that they're either struggling with on margin or they've just not figured out how to help the customer, right?

I'm also tending to lean towards something more on the strategy consulting side that they would have because it seems like overall delivery also seems to be a small portion of their business.

So even if it is something like a 3 to 5 year strategy plan or something for healthcare life sciences business that they're doing currently, and we can help accelerate there and in management.

Consulting, I think I would focus rather than on speed on just a way of working, And the consultants are using AI tools all the time.

What does that look like? And changes the picture of how their delivery model would work. So I assume that would be a good step one to get there for, I think what we have as a demo and plus we can showcase, almost I would frame it as that, you know, that SDLC slide saying, how do we use AI at every part of the delivery process?

But then also then say, by the way, we also use it for our pre-sales, here's an interesting way that we profile customers before we go meet them, so that that gives us a full picture of how we use the tool.

And then they kind of, if they have a pre-sales deal, they want to bring us in, that has an option, but otherwise they'll probably just bring us in for the team part.

I looked at your options over here also, right, Akash? I'm not sure whether the customer for platform thing is something that...

...

[@43:01](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2581.29) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

It resonates with them immediately, resonates with the timeline we are looking at from it will not be, sorry, look, also that setting that 30-60 day arbitrary timeline is good to challenge ourselves, but I don't want to filter out options based on that.

Fair. I think that's just a way to push ourselves. I think the AI transformation for Euron is, I mean, dude, it's literally what we were built for.

If you look at our DNA, that's who we are. Right? At a larger level. Now, everything else that we are doing is sort of means to an aim.

So it's a good objective to have. We may or may not want to hint at in the current meeting.

I don't have strong opinions about it right now. But making sure that from the first meeting onwards, basically look at Sidin's words, right?

That at least we need to be clear that what is it that we want three months down the line.

And of course, just like Amy. Any other sales process, we didn't navigate this. So we may not say what we want like in the first meeting or we may get into it, we may show something that elicits that thing, but let's be clear as to what we want in the longer run, that doesn't necessarily mean that is what we say on Friday.

But yes, I mean, in that context, AI transformation for Huron is where my vote would be, saying that dude, I want this, this is where I want to go, it will be really cool, it will be fun.

They have users, they have customers, they have all wanted is like work for into our system, right, Ventures.

[@44:44](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2684.25) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

So that's the case then I think, and if we sort of cross that with Sidin's point, what you're saying is we're going into use Akash's exo work, Demo, Demo, two, or two.

You that sales acceleration, deal velocity acceleration is where the early alpha is and what we should focus on. But here is our operating system.

It's called Exocortex, which consists of a bunch of these components. And this is what we will implement for you.

So we're implementing our AI platform, but we will go project by project, team by team and transform this for you by objectively increasing velocity and improving margin.

Is that what I, what else would be the play? Is that what we're saying? Is that an accurate summary of the conversation?

Yeah.

[@45:35](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2735.65) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

The moment somebody uses EXO for one project, everybody else would say, I also want to use it for my project.

And then you're on that track. Right.

[@45:48](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2748.31) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

Also in my mind, just very picky on this, but I am almost framing it the opposite way where we're saying that EXO Cortex for way of working.

Is what has delivered. delivered. And by the way, an example is exowork for pre-sales.

[@46:05](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2765.47) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Yes, fair. I agree.

[@46:08](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2768.07) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

You basically put the platform front and center and then you touch upon some use cases. And then of course, given who you are about our understanding is, we can emphasize on certain attack feet.

But then we trace it back to saying that the way we work is, dude, you give us work, we deliver things.

And that is how we make things faster. If at all, you want to talk about how you can use this platform or what things will work, you know, that's like a little downstream.

The first thing is, let's just let's say we should approve of the board.

[@46:40](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2800.07) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

I mean, I think we can be, I can be very, I think we can be very brutally upfront about that.

Because the first question that you have, that we need to answer is whether we are selling snake oil. We want to get through that quickly.

So let's be clear about the objective of the first milestone. You give us a clean, coverable project. We'll talk.

about what it is. We'll deliver it very quickly with very high quality and you satisfy yourself that this is not snake oil because if we keep having that question open down the line, it will be an issue.

[@47:12](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2832.75) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

We will also need a qualifying criteria for such projects. Maybe not, I mean, it may not be the, but we need to have something at least at a first principle level because that is going to be their question.

We might as well have clarity on that.

[@47:24](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2844.73) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

No, we've already said that we should be looking initially. I don't know how they will respond to it, but they should initially be like, yeah, your number one alpha and AI transformation comes in your sales process, not in your delivery process.

So the first project you should take a look at is sales. argument to make. We all agree. Yeah, yeah.

[@47:43](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2863.71) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

Yeah, I think that's a reasonable argument to make. Yes. Do you agree, Rishi?

[@47:52](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2872.95) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

I'm just thinking, what is the quicker win for us? Like if let's say they have a six month. Salesforce project, which they are struggling with, that probably fits easier in our boat to deliver than promising them the next five customers will come quickly.

[@48:10](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2890.21) \- **Steven Sule**

Yeah, but my point on that is that, let's just take that as an example, even if with all the alpha in the world, you're still going to delay this significantly for a deliverable result, right?

You're not taking off a smaller chunk of that pie to see how you work. The point is, to prove that Sidu, Snake Oil, Salesman, whatever the hell you called it, that you need a quicker win.

You need like an NUS grade win. Yes, right? That's the speed that you want.

[@48:37](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2917.77) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

That could be something on the delivery side as well, right?

[@48:40](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2920.61) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

It doesn't need to be part of their pre-sales process.

[@48:42](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2922.45) \- **Steven Sule**

It could even be on, what's it called, requirement gathering, right? It could be like ExoHealth, why the not? Yeah.

No, please.

[@48:52](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2932.75) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

Not ExoHealth, but requirement gathering.

[@48:55](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2935.67) \- **Steven Sule**

my bad. Touchy.

[@49:03](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2943.55) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

Because the pre-sales one, Sidu, will be a little tricky based on what their process is, what their pipeline is, where they stand with respect to customers.

[@49:11](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2951.69) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

You're right, it's just that I have the same concern about delivery. I mean, I have that concern uniformly.

[@49:16](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2956.57) \- **Steven Sule**

I don't know what your process is.

[@49:17](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2957.87) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

I don't know what your talent is like. But why does it matter about their talent?

[@49:22](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2962.89) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

Dude, we are doing delivery.

[@49:25](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2965.51) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

The problem is we need to be able to take that over on our side and then deliver it back objectively faster and better than they would.

So the question now becomes what is that?

[@49:34](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=2974.27) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

So, okay. So that is why I was talking about the qualifying criteria for that. And honestly, the best type of work is anything which is analytics.

Anyway. Because anything that requires delivery, which means that something that goes into production will slow down at the QA acceptance and all of that level.

100%. 100%. So, any type of analysis or things that doesn't affect production, What matters to the company? It might be organ analysis.

I'm just randomly stating that as an example, right? But anything where our skills for organ analysis, knowledge aggregation, requirements gathering, proposals, stuff like that, or prototype building for that matter that basically works out of the production system.

These are the cases where you're not going to run into any customer level acceptance slowdowns.

[@50:31](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=3031.57) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

I would add to that impact analysis, dashboards, anything that we want to see from a management perspective, from systems of record is something we can do very quickly as well.

It's a very BI cut on what they want to look at from a marketing perspective.

[@50:53](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=3053.43) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

We're coming back to engaging with them on this problem, right? Any thoughts, any... Thoughts on, Steve, on how to navigate this sequencing while, in terms of communication, I mean, what are the words we say to them on Friday, like how, because you've seen the personalities, how should we sequence this narrative, given the objectives, Sidin laid out, which I think we're all aligned on, the three months from now, they should be like, , we need to buy these guys.

[@51:20](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=3080.37) \- **Steven Sule**

So I think that the first thing is, yeah, so the first thing is to be able to show them, I mean, start with whatever demo you're going to go with, right, you should be able to show them that there is, they should be just absorbed, so whatever you did on manager, right, the fact that you pulled out manager in front of Ravi and you showed him and you gave him that explanation and he's been, he's already convinced, he just needs to convince the other three Luddites that come to the conversation, that this is, this is not just .

So that's the first sequencing I'll do, I would do. And the second thing is to say that, listen, guys, we've already wasted three meetings over this.

Let's start with a particular workflow or a particular project. Like there's enough talk now because now we can have another demo, we can have another conversation, you can see some other part of our thing.

Just give us one particular problem to solve. We've already signed an NDA. Let's make it a quick paid POC so that you get conviction and I can prove to you what it is that we bring to the table.

Simple.

[@52:24](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=3144.19) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

There is one more line item that I want to add. If they explicitly mention, I picked it from your comments, Steve, that now our people have to go and learn something new, right?

AI adoption from a long-term perspective is a problem for them. Of course, we are facing the same thing.

[@52:42](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=3162.33) \- **Steven Sule**

May not actually be Friday's audience's problem because they are that weird group that Sidu would call like, we have AI everywhere, but we know everything.

So it's not that you need to get these guys to get the win within their organization because they've been shitting the bed on things already.

So like, they become your means to an end. The guy who's managing… Did they take a stance with you on the call, Steve?

No, no, no, they didn't. They didn't.

[@53:12](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=3192.71) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Okay. Sorry, I think the following question I had there is like, what is the roadmap we're painting? I agree with you, Steve, up to this point.

I think the question is, what is the roadmap we're shrinking and saying we will do this and then we will do this, this and this.

What is the business in this after the proof point saying, oh, we've delivered this for you. Now, you know, this is not snake oil.

You know exactly how much alpha there is.

[@53:36](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=3216.79) \- **Steven Sule**

So the roadmap goes that the moment you have a proof point and a tangible proof point, right? You move up from one layer from Ravi and you go straight to having a conversation with Rick who has the problem of his stock price collapsing.

Right? He has a business that he is responsible for that extends beyond the 15% of Salesforce delivery what Ravi has.

Ravi's ask is simply a proof point right now to say that on the Salesforce. know exactly is coming Side, can deliver.

Then your conversation to Rick is that, dude, I've shown you what I can do on Salesforce. I can do this off Salesforce.

You want to do another quick POC off Salesforce? Let's do that with one of your customers, preferably a customer that you have fronted in your career.

So we can find a workflow, automate, do whatever it is we need to prove it to you. Then you can see the tangible benefits of the way we operate and extrapolate that from our working method to what it would look like at scale at your working method.

The nuances of how you adopt our workflow is the finer details that we can talk to. But first, let us prove this to you to directly one of your clients.

We've proved it in your organization at the Salesforce level. Let us prove it to you on a consulting level.

What else do you need now?

[@54:55](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=3295.63) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

How do we make sure that at that juncture for that stage? We are not inadvertently creating the conviction in them that they can now figure this out themselves.

[@55:06](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=3306.19) \- **Steven Sule**

That you have to tell me whether it's possible or not, Masha? No, I don't know. I mean, this is a dinosaur joke.

like, you know it's not possible. I know it's not possible.

[@55:14](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=3314.83) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

They don't know it's not possible. They'll be like, yeah, we'll take the platform. I mean, they alluded to that, right, boss.

[@55:19](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=3319.35) \- **Steven Sule**

We don't want to, is it possible for not just you guys to do the work independently, but also for us to sit there embedded within your workflow so we can see how the sausage is made.

So, I mean, that's what they also want to be able to gauge, right? How complex it is, this to create on their own, number one.

Number two, not only complex, but now to drive adoption, as Akar said, that's another issue. So, I don't have an answer, bro, honestly.

Okay, fair. ranted at you. Sidhan?

[@55:58](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=3358.11) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

I think what we're actually doing doing them. It's a little bit vague, but we're actually saying we will tokenize all your expertise into a system that helps you do more work faster, right?

Essentially, that's what we're saying. You've got this bunch of experts, you understand all of these verticals really well, you don't know how to use AI.

The only way you can scale up as a company is if we can tokenize your expertise, which is we can, expert plus model is greater than whatever, right?

I don't know how to solve it, but my thinking is that they will, I don't know, Rishi, you'll have to correct me.

If we do one project, they'll immediately want to roll it out to a second one, chances are they will not be able to do it by themselves.

They will not. What they will need to see from us is that every level of scaling you do, you will need Realfast to help you scale along with it.

Yes. Yes.

[@56:40](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=3400.43) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

And I mean, that's objectively true even within Realfast today, right? We are seeing that. Yes.

[@56:46](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=3406.27) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

And partly what you can do is you can say, look, this is what we've done for existing clients, right?

I don't know, I mean, you might have to make up the story, Steve, I'm not sure. But, it is, look, we work with clients and they, we scale along with them.

They cannot scale independent of us because Siddu. Like you said, it's one thing to say we deliver faster. It's another thing to scale that XO all the way to scales.

[@57:06](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=3426.95) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

That they're not going to be able to do.

[@57:08](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=3428.17) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

That extraction is, I think, too far for a consulting firm to do.

[@57:11](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=3431.99) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

I think that's one part of it, but Sidin just giving you that color from inside real fast, right? When they try to roll this out, which is true, even when we try to, we're facing this today, today morning, this was the topic of debate.

There are people in the company who will just refuse to use the tooling. Just point blank refuse. Right? So now, I mean, I'm not even sure we can make inroads on that line of attack.

Even the, even if you ask me, like, how are you going to transform them? I'd be like, dude, you need to give me hire and fire authority.

Otherwise, it's not possible. And the people I'm going to hire are going to completely with your unity comics because the price point in which you're used to hiring, not this price point.

And the moment you pull that thread, honestly, the logical outcome is you sell and we'll deliver.

[@57:58](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=3478.85) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

That's the only.

[@58:00](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=3480.01) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

Logical outcome if you pull that correctly, which is why even I met a bit of a… Let me leave it at an abstract level where it doesn't go into this complexity, right?

We are saying that we, Realfast fundamentally extracts your institutional knowledge as people work within your system, plus from your existing contracts, code bases, whatever the hell it is.

We basically extract all of this information into Exocortex and we maintain it over there and keep it aligned to the way the business is working.

We can onboard newer domains onto this, we can onboard newer people into it, we can make sure that the… Like our platform makes sure that the information is always fresh.

This is what the platform does and because the platform manages it in this particular way, plus the UX that we are providing, you won't have, I mean, you will have far lesser AI adoption challenges in the system.

This platform is what real… Brings to the table and sort of maintain it. So of course, your people can use the platform and start delivering at a productive level.

We also want that. But there is a licensing component of the underlying platform and the services that we provide.

And whenever you want to do any process transition, you know, like process re-engineering within, we will have our consultants looking at the data and also tell you what process re-engineering you can do to get the improvements that you need.

But those are the places where you will have to work with our consultants on top of our platform and we will sort of own all the data engineering and all the related problems that are there.

So this is an endgame.

[@59:39](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=3579.87) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Akash, just confirming with you, right? What you are painting over here is an endgame picture which people can make a leap of say jump to without getting into the weeds on the intermediate structure.

Yeah, exactly.

[@59:50](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=3590.95) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

Exactly. How can it So let's But they know that you will to extract knowledge. They will be consultants, right?

They know that they maintain and maintain, the business processes will change. As the... Underlying tooling changes and their business realities changes, the workflows are going to change.

Dude, who is going to maintain all this? You are currently worried about where my people will use AI or not.

That means, okay, that means, yeah, look at this nice, pretty UI with everything fully integrated. It is the ERP that you get, which is why it's easier for people to use.

That's an adoption problem. But that's just tip of the iceberg. I mean, something to this effect.

[@1:00:25](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=3625.07) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

I have two points to this, right? So one is in terms of how do we ensure that they don't feel that they can replicate it.

That is just at the pace that we do it. And we have to keep like, when we talk about it, we have to say, you know, we've done this X, Y, Z, we've done this, this, this, it would have taken six months for you to get to this point, but whatever, that is one way of doing it.

I think the second tactical way of doing that is the first three things that we pick up with Euron are three very different things.

So they also get a sense that, okay, these guys can work across, right? So let's say we do one thing in healthcare, we do something else in life sciences, do something, uh, healthcare strategy consulting then healthcare.

There's something in delivery, and then something in their pre-sales part, right? So suddenly they see AI transformation across three different areas, and they realize that this takes some amount of expertise to get there.

The second part is, and Aakash, this is where I'm going to go converse to what you are saying. I would not say that the UI and EXO makes it easy for their employees to use it.

It is hard to use. There is a steep learning curve. Our guys have got past that sterling curve. We are happy to help show you how it works.

But it will take a long time for your team to learn it. So I will need a top-down mandate from you to enforce these standards in any team that we're working with.

Is a better bargaining chip that I would go for? Absolutely.

[@1:01:42](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=3702.69) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

Yeah. It's not disagreeing the bad part.

[@1:01:46](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=3706.55) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

The minute we say it's easy to use them, that immediately brings in the picture that, okay, maybe... No, I'll tell you why I was going down that path.

[@1:01:53](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=3713.05) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

I didn't have a lot of considered thoughts there. But the reason I was going down that particular path is...

... Um... ... ... I don't want them to think that they will, for the long term, have to keep using our people and their people can't adopt because ultimately, realistically, if are thinking of acquiring us, they are doing it for their people, right?

So I don't know how to basically bridge that particular gap, but that is why I was going down that.

It's not a strong opinion.

[@1:02:19](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=3739.61) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

That's fine. As in, I think we also will have to message this at some point of time that their best people will be able to use it and they will also go down that path eventually in consulting, assume.

Yes. But I don't want to be the one saying that should have any way. Sure.

[@1:02:35](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=3755.93) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

Anyway, stepping back, I think sort of, we've sort of gone around this elephant multiple ways.

[@1:02:45](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=3765.51) \- **Sidin Vadukut**

Also, you want them to get the fear that, my God, my competitors should not get hands on this. Yeah.

**ACTION ITEM: Prepare Huron demo narrative/flow; share w/ Steven, Aakash, Sidu \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=3773.9999)**

There's also something you want them to think about fairly quickly. Yes. If our three-month plan is acquiring us, I'm just saying.

Well, thank you.

[@1:03:04](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=3784.71) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

So what do we do on Friday? Can we first agree upon what is the takeaway that we want? Okay, so I'll just complete my point.

Uh, look, I think we have had just so many conversations, Rishi, can you just go through this transcript to figure out that this is the pitch that we are making?

These are the points that we are making, we just, let's just agree on that. Because I think using the, so there are two things, right?

One is the demo. Uh, second thing is the examples that we call out. Uh, I think modifying the demo to, something, we'll, we'll figure it out, but let's first start from the narrative side and then we can, uh, then we can, uh, move to what exactly we are going to demo and stuff.

think that's much more downstream.

[@1:03:55](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=3835.33) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

Yeah, and I think in terms of demo, uh, we have a bunch of. I think just how we use it internally on delivery, on pre-sales, on recruitment, on even slack are good enough examples that will excite them about efficiency.

Like sometimes the examples that we use are so far ahead that we don't think that it will be impressive to people.

Right. But like, for example, even what Sidu just fractional leave, two hours of leave, PTO, et cetera, sort of stuff from a delivery perspective, very, very exciting for them because they can now do real-time demand and supply planning sort of things also.

Uh, much more flexibility in there, which is a good delivery model, but yeah, I think there are enough and more examples to show them narrative.

Let me lock down on and come back. Uh, yeah, I'm just calling out. am on leave tomorrow and Friday, so I will be there on Thursday, but I'll do something today and share it across and then wait for thoughts.

Friday, will you be able to join that meeting? What time? What time is it? we go.

[@1:05:00](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=3900.01) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

It would be better to have you there.

**ACTION ITEM: Reschedule Huron demo to Fri PM; confirm w/ Vinay, Ravi, Rick; update invites \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=3902.9999)**

[@1:05:02](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=3902.75) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

So, there's some pooja at home in the morning. So, first half, I'm out. But if, what time is it?

you know? I actually don't even have it on my calendar.

[@1:05:10](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=3910.85) \- **Steven Sule**

don't know who has it. Oh, can we just set it in the second half then, Steve? I don't, I don't know who's coordinating this, to be honest.

I, no idea. Sidu, is it on yours?

[@1:05:23](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=3923.81) \- **Rishi Ayyer (Realfast)**

No, I just checked. I don't see anything on mine.

[@1:05:28](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=3928.17) \- **Steven Sule**

Okay, I guess we'll ask Vinay then. Let me ask him. Give me a second. I'll coordinate. Yeah, Vinay was originally driving, so.

Okay, okay. Yeah, I'll, I'll figure it out. I'll coordinate with back with you. then.

[@1:05:48](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=3948.71) \- **Sidu Ponnappa**

Then, let's try to get this set up for the second half, so Rishi can do that. Yeah.

[@1:05:54](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=3954.13) \- **Steven Sule**

Yeah. Rishi, send the narrative and then we can work on that.

[@1:05:56](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=3956.81) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

Yep, I'll send that.

[@1:05:58](https://fathom.video/calls/562828453?timestamp=3958.57) \- **Steven Sule**

Okay. Thank you. Thanks. Sidin, I'll chat with you tomorrow, yeah? Yeah, I'll set up a time with you. No, it's already set, though.

Oh, is it? Okay, cool. Yeah, all right, bye.
