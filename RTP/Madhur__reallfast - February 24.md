[**VIEW RECORDING \- 47 mins (No highlights)**](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522)

Because you gotta go, and I'll be on the call when you come back. Hey, folks, how are you? Hey, how's it going?

[@4:40](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=280.66) \- **Madhur Makkar (RTP Ventures)**

All good, all good. Sorry for running late.

[@4:42](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=282.74) \- **Steven Sule**

Aren't you glad you're not in a blizzard? No, no, I didn't go, no.

[@4:46](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=286.88) \- **Madhur Makkar (RTP Ventures)**

I know, said, aren't you glad?

[@4:48](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=288.7) \- **Steven Sule**

Yeah, I am. I am, I am. You could have been building a snowman instead, you're talking to us?

[@4:54](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=294.88) \- **Madhur Makkar (RTP Ventures)**

Or, or, uh, would have been stuck somewhere in a different part of the world. blizzard for You I, but one....

I'm rford. want New York as well could have been in newfoundland.

[@5:03](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=303.54) \- **Steven Sule**

Yeah.

[@5:05](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=305.04) \- **Madhur Makkar (RTP Ventures)**

I mean, you don't even know what's the snow, maybe not even land.

[@5:11](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=311.62) \- **Steven Sule**

You have something to tell your kids and your wife.

[@5:14](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=314.54) \- **Madhur Makkar (RTP Ventures)**

Yeah. Yeah. True. All right. Cool.

[@5:18](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=318.94) \- **Steven Sule**

Okay. How do we do this? Um, the easiest way we, we, we think it would be, uh, sort of fruitful is to sort of just understand from you, um, what are some of the things that you do on a regular basis on a weekly basis or a biweekly basis that are boring, mundane, take up your time and quite honestly give you no return for what you have to do it for, but it's a task that you have to complete in some way or form.

[@5:49](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=349.46) \- **Madhur Makkar (RTP Ventures)**

So I'll, uh, do the entire process mapping for me and also show you my screen so that it is clear.

Um, the first. A of anything is sourcing a company, there are multitudes of things that we do, some bits of which are outsourced to an intern, some bit of which we do ourselves, some bit of which we learn from the network, So there are three things that are happening.

One is the intern work. So I'll just open it.

[@6:27](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=387.12) \- **Sidu Ponnappa (Realfast)**

Madhur, have the note taker on, that's okay, right? Yeah, I also have an answer, it's fine.

[@6:34](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=394.88) \- **Madhur Makkar (RTP Ventures)**

So any, the first thing that the intern does is any deal announcement that happens in the day, they make a note of it, they build a newsletter as to what the company is doing, et cetera, et cetera, then release.

So we decide who to reach out from that or not. That is one bit. Any company that posts a job online.

So these are digital signals that we're looking for. One, two hundred employees, whatever, right? So this is one bit of sourcing.

The second bit is LinkedIn, which of course, everyone's managing their own. So different signals, digital traces of people leave via sales nav, starting, moving out, company change, a new connect of a fund investor that we care about.

So all of those signals again, lead to sourcing. And then last is we speak to multiple people in the network, operators, founders, VCs, and get a sense of what's happening and try to get those things.

Now, uh, bits and pieces of this is automated.

[@7:39](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=459.68) \- **Sidu Ponnappa (Realfast)**

Not everything is, then are there any tools that you routinely use for pieces of this workflow consistently or others in the flow would use?

[@7:48](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=468.28) \- **Madhur Makkar (RTP Ventures)**

Um, so sales nav on LinkedIn, which automates everything on your list buildings, on your specific criteria. Yup. On, um...

Though, on listening to what's being released on the internet about rounds, we tried multiple, like, like, Google News Notifs to begin with four or five years back to now, practically, agents, but, but it's not as accurate as it wanted to be.

So, so an intern is also involved.

[@8:22](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=502.581) \- **Sidu Ponnappa (Realfast)**

Is there any CRM type system? So, so once that happens, there's CRM flow, so I'll share.

[@8:39](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=519.341) \- **Madhur Makkar (RTP Ventures)**

You can see my screen. Not yet.

[@8:44](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=524.561) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

Now, can you? Yes. Okay.

[@8:48](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=528.661) \- **Madhur Makkar (RTP Ventures)**

So affinity is the CRM that we use, anytime that we source a deal, the first thing we would do is check if the deal already exists in the, for hanging.

guess The system. If not, we'll create that. And then the process starts. So it's at a new state, you'll reach out, we'll move the state.

Then if the founder reverts, we'll have the conversation. At this point in time, you would have, like we'll use outreach sequencing for emails if they're doing it, LinkedIn sequencing via different tools.

We don't do it because of rate limits that we care about that not being hit at LinkedIn block. And then at every single point in time, we'll keep updating the CRM, which is the hardest part and diligence lags on.

I'm sure you'll see that in your sales, uh, so this is the workflow that we get into from the entire journey of sourcing to completing a deal, if we get excited by something and that goes deeper, we move into diligence.

Uh, this is where we use Claude GPT capabilities on some bit of research. But you have to go very deep, but initial pointers, use that and then, for example, if we have to go into primary research and do customer conversations, multitudes, we'll use voice AI solutions as well against third party tools, not something we're building out, you will do market research via them and then eventually do the deal that isn't like and then post that's working with the portfolio, you try to get regular stuff from them.

In these calls also, of course, you try to take all notes via your meeting boards, everything flows into the CRM directly, Post that I think so last last bit is working on the portfolio, whatever data comes building context, helping them multiple things.

So this is the entire journey that takes I think so. The most redundant part of what I do is moving and I

Stuff for my CRM that I don't enjoy doing everything else is stimulating the brain. This is a non stimulating piece of brain, and there are other small things, like calendarization, all of those for which people are, I don't use personally, but because I like to control my calendar, but I mean, there are tools for that.

I've decided against it. I really want to be on top of it. So that is the only reason.

[@11:24](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=684.801) \- **Steven Sule**

So when you talk about specific high alpha things that you are doing, right, where you are using logic, brain space, and all of the things that you want, is there a repeated flow that you are following in your mind for certain activities within those subsections that you talked about?

For example, like if there is a company that pops up because of the digital signals that you got, that second human layer of inference or analysis that you are doing to say whether or not this should be moved from interesting to should that are laufen

schedule a call. That thought process is done completely manually right now. And it's a judgment call on your part, right?

So we've automated it right to a point we can write.

[@12:10](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=730.401) \- **Madhur Makkar (RTP Ventures)**

So there's a first cut analysis of that company that happens. Then we, for all of these, which are not self-sourced, which is through digital signals, because there's so much noise coming in, you don't want to look at everything.

So, so there's one bit of analysis of pulling data and some sources that are available, plus an intern who will also get data in terms of who the founders are, et cetera, which is not directly available, do some research and then doing a shortlist of those, let's say 25 announced rounds were announced this week, bring it down to five, six of interest.

Every Friday, we'll have a 12 noon catch up or 30 minutes with the intern saying that all this should happen in the week.

These companies posted new job. These many rounds happened. I believe these are of interest. Why? And these are not of interest.

Why? This is about all the rounds that happened that are announced in that day, this data is pulled from traction database, all of this, but they just compile it and send it, and practically all of this is pulled, they just double check it, everything is in order or not.

Is there a central repository of all of these being maintained?

[@14:27](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=867.062) \- **Sidu Ponnappa (Realfast)**

Yes, then then what happens is, this is where the intent does it.

[@14:30](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=870.462) \- **Madhur Makkar (RTP Ventures)**

I'll just, I think I'm not shared the browser, let me share the complete browser. So, then all of these are posted on Affinity by the intern.

So... If we filter this, for example, she's the intern, right? So she has posted it, and has done a first cut analysis of why this is interesting or not interesting.

And the answer is not interesting. So move to aware, no interest in status change.

[@15:32](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=932.522) \- **Sidu Ponnappa (Realfast)**

So what I'm seeing actually across the notes is there is an underlying ontology for the analysis that you have, which is completely standardized.

Yeah.

[@15:44](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=944.982) \- **Madhur Makkar (RTP Ventures)**

And it's, it's more like, there are four or five, we don't expect them to do a lot of work.

It's like, it's noise reduction, it's one in time, right? So there are three, four things that we care about depending on the company.

What are they doing? Space. Space. Space. Money raised raised from when we say space, highly competitive, not competitive, who are the founders, the founder profiles and LinkedIn, is the founder market fit or not?

And if company is slightly late, is there some bit of data available of the traction, like logos on the website, who they have signed up or not?

So, so this is not by structure, this is by what we know for a fact is going to be available as data in 90, 95% of the cases, as we try to put all of that data in one place, and then we use that to come to a game.

That is the only basis behind it. No, that makes sense.

[@16:42](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=1002.54) \- **Sidu Ponnappa (Realfast)**

But I think the fact that that report has a standardized set of viewpoints that you're developing means that we can now replicate it across the board, given the same, same source data, right?

[@16:54](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=1014.34) \- **Madhur Makkar (RTP Ventures)**

Yeah.

[@16:58](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=1018.08) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

But, sorry, just a...

[@17:00](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=1020.0) \- **Sidu Ponnappa (Realfast)**

Looking at these problem statements through a different lens, right? If I asked you to prioritize your objective over here as being speed, cost, and accuracy, how would you prioritize?

[@17:18](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=1038.36) \- **Madhur Makkar (RTP Ventures)**

Accuracy, speed, and cost.

[@17:20](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=1040.88) \- **Sidu Ponnappa (Realfast)**

And when you say accuracy, what do you mean by accuracy? Like, you talking about like numerical accuracy in terms of like, whatever computed numbers are exactly on point or directional accuracy that yes, okay, the specific details make it hallucinated, but directionally it will be always on point.

[@17:40](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=1060.04) \- **Madhur Makkar (RTP Ventures)**

Uh, I think so directional, but, but still should not be hallucinated to an extent that the founder profiles are wrong.

Like, practically, practically, no, no, don't I'm talking about math.

[@17:54](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=1074.42) \- **Sidu Ponnappa (Realfast)**

Math, math, will always be issues, and then you have to do a double.

[@17:57](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=1077.08) \- **Madhur Makkar (RTP Ventures)**

It's not math there, but at this point, there's zero math. It's more like pulling data from one place to the other.

That is it. No calculations are done. So for us, that is there, but I think so and to your point, I generally don't care about whatever I showed you and I'll tell you why, because it has, there's a process for me.

I'll be replacing an intern with a agent and that is it, I don't care in turn is not available.

That is the only time I care. Right. But the intern ensures that the data is 100% accurate and don't worry about it.

And the process is such that even intern handover is now outsourced, the old intern handover, the museum. So I am living in a system where I don't have to interact also, which is amazing for me, but.

Where I feel it is difficult is, there are, in terms of not high value people, for us, I mean it in a very positive way.

No, I get it. Yes.

[@19:13](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=1153.06) \- **Sidu Ponnappa (Realfast)**

You don't have to carry it. For example, Rahul, right.

[@19:15](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=1155.8) \- **Madhur Makkar (RTP Ventures)**

In Rahul's case, I would rather have Rahul spending most of his time on founder calls, but a lot of time gets wasted.

I think so. spend an hour a day on our CRM to update stuff, move stuff, to understand stuff. We miss out on a lot of context because it's not getting pulled from different directions.

And at the same point in time, if we are not spending that one hour, we are not adding that context anywhere.

So everything's getting lost. And practically it's been, every year we begin, take out a week in the beginning of the year to correct every past wrong mistake that happened.

And, and that is what, so what I want to do. So, like... Personally, like this was something I wanted to build for myself every time, like, so, so affinity, we put a new company in all data fields are to be updated two days.

The status has not changed. I get a ping from my bot. Did you reach out ensuring that I reach out or not?

And, and then this is also pushing the team, right? Like if they have not reached out for the day, you have not reached out.

This is the time limit for this. I am moving this to someone else. So people ensure that some, something is action.

So, and founders also have a good experience because they, their loop gets closed sooner. So this is what, yeah, this is what I really care about.

Actioning happening via messaging on a Slack assistant, which updates affinity through workflows that I have created and mapped and timelines and SLAs that have to be there too, and, and the source of truth being the CRM.

This is. Thank This is excellent.

[@21:00](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=1260.66) \- **Sidu Ponnappa (Realfast)**

So look, I'll let Aakash take over after this, but I'll just explain to you our framework. We have two frameworks which are in, which are being used in live projects right now and they solve the problem through different lenses depending on the context.

Now, one operating model is to say, identify an operational flow with a clear timeline and clear SLS. Now you have an issue on that flow where you need to change those numbers.

Either there is a business driver to speed up the timeline, or there is a business driver to scale the number of transactions flowing through that without scaling headcount, right?

Or we are seeing that we are failing to meet SLS, we have to bring this system up to a point where we are meeting SLS.

These are the only things that happen in this, right? Identify which of these is, and then enter into the problem with the lowest of Lofi.

Now, the interesting thing once AI has come through is earlier Lofi was like, hello, I will make you an app.

Let me give you a six up design mockup. We'll do all it. Now, all of that is gone, that .

Now, what we figure out is, what is the customer's simple? This set of prompts to achieve automation there. For example, from what you're telling me, would speculate that if we plug in Cloud over and the Affinity MCT, we will very quickly be able to make two or three prompts and those two or three prompts will, will dramatically crunch your update time because this is how we operate, right?

We update Salesforce through an MCT, no one is updating Salesforce by hand and that means the updates are detailed, they are fresh and they are timely because you don't have that cognitive load, right?

If you give a certain amount of direction, then the next layer after this is to say that, look, now, are there things that we are doing with the prompts, which we need to bake into a larger team based flow?

Do we need to federate these prompts to other people? Yeah. Once the workflow is running stably, now you start looking at accuracy.

Now you're like, look, running these with prompts is great, but no matter what you do with prompts, there's some amount of variation in outcome.

In this case, we should actually build a small app.

[@22:52](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=1372.8) \- **Madhur Makkar (RTP Ventures)**

Yeah.

[@22:53](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=1373.2) \- **Sidu Ponnappa (Realfast)**

Because there, we don't want the AI variability, it is a completely deterministic operation flow form whatever. But it's operational step one, step two, it is better done with traditional software, we will migrate it from a product to that.

But the overarching focus always is on the operational numbers and assets. And we prioritize everything based on that. Right?

So this is one model. The other model is more individual focused. Right? We are not taking a team lens.

We are saying that for you personally, and that was the question that Steve asked. That is the discovery question we have for that.

[@23:27](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=1407.28) \- **Madhur Makkar (RTP Ventures)**

Right?

[@23:27](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=1407.72) \- **Sidu Ponnappa (Realfast)**

Which is for example, like actual example in one of our customers is like, she, she's like, I have to fill a six page form at procurement every day.

Yeah. Right? And there again, the solution is what is the fastest thing we can do? No apps and all that.

Can we install Google X for budget Y and start iterating on the workflow very quickly. It's a personal productivity.

So now we can approach this through either of the lenses, given that you are the stakeholder, you have line of sight on the whole flow.

And we've talked about both. Individual. Usually we can look at this as saying, how do we start with Madhur and build in the simplest possible toolchain, ideally off the shelf, where his constant CRM updation problem is dramatically mitigated.

The other lens we could take is to say, okay, let us look at the operational workflow. We are looking at deal, I mean, responsiveness within the deal cycle as the core metric.

We have SLAs on this. How can we turn this into something that is unbeatable in the industry? We can take either of these thoughts.

I don't know, Akash, if you have a point of view, but I think Madhur, that's almost a customer question.

Yeah, I think it's very much customer question.

[@24:37](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=1477.66) \- **Madhur Makkar (RTP Ventures)**

I think so. The answer is number two and what the first part was my answer to how to get there.

So if I were to give a problem statement, I want my entire team to be working on SLAs, ensuring that everything is updated on the workflow as soon as possible.

Now, how do we get there is, is what I told you as to what I've Felt was the right way to do it.

Right. So we can, we can figure it out. So the business statement or problem statement was that. Got it.

[@25:07](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=1507.92) \- **Sidu Ponnappa (Realfast)**

Okay. Aakash, think.

[@25:10](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=1510.8) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

Third off now. Yeah. So, uh, yeah, the entire basically business operating on, uh, SLAs. This also, so, okay. the typical questions on this is one, uh, who are the stakeholders typically involved?

You did mention, uh, the, uh, the interns that are there, but what are the rules that come into this particular operation cycle?

Uh, what you described, does it cover everything like that you have already gone through? Because we'll just put it, pull it from the transcript.

Then we don't need to go through that. Yeah.

[@25:46](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=1546.3) \- **Madhur Makkar (RTP Ventures)**

I mean, if I just share again, so this will become super clear in terms of how the workflow runs.

We have to. нак So it's for everybody, but practically me and the analyst and the intern use it. This is where the owners are described.

Who is it? Now, for example, I put this new yesterday, I'm already connected. So the status should have, this is the movement flow rate at a rate is a closed state.

So aware, no interest, like we don't want to speak to this person. This is that that is impending on action.

We've reached out. connected by yet to speak. This is not what nothing happened. Then we need to escalate it to other people.

Right now, let's move to in contact. So practically, SLA is between these. So you can assume this to be if else graph that flows into end states.

And SLA is for each point of movement is what we care about. The person responsible for this movement is the owner here.

And that is it. So, so it's, it's more like we need to know, but we don't want to spend active efforts.

So, so this is where in all, all five of us, 30 minutes a week goes maximum.

[@28:13](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=1693.26) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

Okay. So let's then just completely ignore that part. Like that's a very low amount of time that goes there.

[@28:18](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=1698.84) \- **Madhur Makkar (RTP Ventures)**

Right.

[@28:19](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=1699.12) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

The second one I assume is the analyst. So now if we, ideally we would, where we would want to jump into this is you already shown us what the workflow looks like.

Now, the first question is, are we already measuring the SLAs? Do we know what is the workflow step, which actually takes the most amount of time?

And then we just go and figure out like what needs to be done there? Like what information is available?

What is the decision that needs to be made? Which are the sources from which we get the information? And we figure out how much of that can be done to agent.

[@28:53](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=1733.6) \- **Madhur Makkar (RTP Ventures)**

Like, like my problem is not what takes the most time. Like just to go deeper into the problem, the problem is things get.

It missed and hence they take a lot of time. So now the data is going to be deeply flawed if you go there because people do not update statuses.

Things reach starting state to end state without going through multiple steps in the middle, which are in people's heads.

So this is not the right representation of where it took most time. And the idea is to be closing those loops sooner.

Now, what, what I can give you is my recommendation or benchmarks of status movements as to what they should be.

That is what is possible specifically in today's daily, like what our understanding of the flows are.

[@29:49](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=1789.8) \- **Steven Sule**

Sorry, I mean, just to close that.

[@29:51](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=1791.72) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

So that is why you're focusing on, it's almost like nudging people to update is the first set of problems.

a long Before I get,

[@30:00](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=1800.0) \- **Madhur Makkar (RTP Ventures)**

So data as to where it is taking them. don't even have that. Now I have a recommended time per step, which will also evolve after we get that data.

[@30:08](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=1808.98) \- **Sidu Ponnappa (Realfast)**

So you're just curious here, right? Like I'm assuming that a lot of these nudges are already in place and automated, like you mentioned earlier, right?

Like there's a ping after two days. It's not automated. It's not automated. Okay. Fair enough. So the place where I was going with that is when you see nudge people, right?

What is the most effective channel to nudge people?

[@30:31](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=1831.2) \- **Madhur Makkar (RTP Ventures)**

I feel it's going to be WhatsApp and Slack and the outcome should lead to a multi-way integration, wherein your response there also leads to an update on affinity and vice versa.

Right now, the nudges are there. Practically, how do we set that nudges? It's a reminder within the CRM and then the CRM sends you an email, which gets swiped left on superhuman.

So, nothing really happens, right? That is what it is.

[@30:57](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=1857.84) \- **Sidu Ponnappa (Realfast)**

Got it. So WhatsApp and Slack.

[@31:04](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=1864.34) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

Okay. That's actually fairly targeted and honestly has nothing to do with AI. It's, it's a core sort of a basic workflow problem over there.

Yeah, it's pretty fast.

[@31:17](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=1877.3) \- **Sidu Ponnappa (Realfast)**

But the interesting thing over here to Akash is, this is very simple and clear because the operations are very crisp, right?

But at the same time, it is straight up a small value. It's a small, it's a very small value.

[@31:31](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=1891.78) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

Yeah, but you're right.

[@31:33](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=1893.0) \- **Sidu Ponnappa (Realfast)**

There is no significant AI here. There's like a lot of bridging that you're doing just to sweet things up.

Yes. That's the first cut. Yes.

[@31:40](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=1900.2) \- **Madhur Makkar (RTP Ventures)**

That is one, right. The other thing is movement across different platforms from LinkedIn to, I mean, practically, whatever I'm going to say is not going to be AI in the typical sense of what you're saying.

But stuff from...

[@32:00](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=1920.0) \- **Sidu Ponnappa (Realfast)**

LinkedIn being updated on the CRM that we care about, right, of course, that's a very, very common requirement. That's fair.

No, not an issue.

[@32:10](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=1930.56) \- **Madhur Makkar (RTP Ventures)**

Yeah. So, and then the last piece is getting all the context that exists from different places for a company practically on this side.

So when we go diligence, now what we do is all of our board decks, all of our granola notes, all of our previous memo, all of the quarterly reporting that we do for you, the MISs that we get, and then we do a one pager commentary, which is mine, like, what's good, what's bad, what's to be done, right?

We collect all of that, feed it in, ask ChatGP, Claude, as to what do you feel is the sentiment of the company and how it's progressing, and then try to validate what we've put in the memo for factual accuracy.

Thank you. I might have written Realfast is doing for two years, and then I bring it for pro rata, so the team should be able to get back to me saying this does not make sense, so I think so, there's a lot of, I think so, what I'm also not asking is, what I'm trying to get to is to not take away any of the place where I use my bin, but everything that is workflow to be out of my hands, this is what I'm getting.

Just one question when you're talking about the CRM, right?

[@33:32](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=2012.84) \- **Steven Sule**

You said the biggest pain point is that things get missed. Yeah, right? How do you currently handle things that get missed?

Like, how do you identify that? Oh, , we missed it? I don't know.

[@33:45](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=2025.54) \- **Madhur Makkar (RTP Ventures)**

So you don't know what you don't even know what you missed?

[@33:48](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=2028.36) \- **Steven Sule**

I don't.

[@33:50](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=2030.18) \- **Madhur Makkar (RTP Ventures)**

There are things that we normally missed it. For example, missing out on a deal, which is okay, but have I missed on closing a loop

And then I would choose which ones I like. So this filtering also can happen, by the way, like this is where, like, it's basic sets of filtering, those need to move to the CRM, check if they already exist or not, and then a reach out also needs to happen.

So this, all of this can be automated, practically. And I think, so the intelligence there is some bit of intelligence there has to pick, pick which of these spotty Fondo profiles I care about.

Yeah, and to an extent, we have our framework to it, like everyone has their own taste, which can be added here.

[@35:32](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=2132.43) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

Everybody can express their taste in the form of some basic prioritization and blob of, you know, dump that they give.

Okay, so predominantly it's a sales nav update. So even if you're, let's say, not able to automate that, actually making it easy and fast would still sort of work.

Yes, yes.

[@35:55](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=2155.93) \- **Madhur Makkar (RTP Ventures)**

And, and practically, yeah, like,

[@37:02](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=2222.39) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

The second piece that we discussed is the SalesNav specifically, just limit to that right now. That data being updated in Affinity at a certain frequency for the...

You know, there is a third one.

[@37:15](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=2235.59) \- **Sidu Ponnappa (Realfast)**

The third one is a very straightforward Affinity integration with some basic prompt workflows to crash Madhur's daily CRM update time, personally.

[@37:27](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=2247.39) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

No, but for the daily CRM update, what is the source of information, right? The source of information was effectively...

[@37:34](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=2254.35) \- **Sidu Ponnappa (Realfast)**

I know, I'm saying that if you ignore that integration problem right now and say that how is Madhur doing the update today, you must be copy pasting only, like what are the choices there?

Now, let's assume we retain the copy paste as the way in which we are bridging the systems for now.

But instead, what we focus on is saying that now the tedious process of converting this information into a specific structure, that is then updated into specific Affinity tickets, which are then moved to the correct statuses.

Basically what we have for our ticketing workflow, right?

[@38:02](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=2282.53) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

It's just basically setting up cloud co-work with a couple of hooks, right?

[@38:06](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=2286.37) \- **Sidu Ponnappa (Realfast)**

But that also is on the table.

[@38:09](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=2289.15) \- **Madhur Makkar (RTP Ventures)**

Yeah. But I mean, there's no need to copy paste because everything has been like, wherever we could, we could understand how to, how to build those integrations we have, right?

Practically. Amazing. Even better. Our call notes, like my post this call, what's going to happen is the call note is going to come on Granola.

I'll put it in my portfolio folder, right? When you say portfolio folder, where is this folder? Oh, on Granola.

So Granola, and then this is APR integration, which takes it from Granola and it would also have your email address will understand that this is real fast, will update notes on affinity for real fast.

So this would also get updated. Status is something that we have not practically, if you look at it, my converse and let's talk about intelligence, right?

have.cosmoney And that's being Yeah. Part of things that that is there.

[@40:01](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=2401.31) \- **Sidu Ponnappa (Realfast)**

I just didn't want to get it because my first piece of business, basically the integration part is even easier solved now.

So the question now is, would you prioritize taking that one hour activity every day and crunching it down to say 10 days?

[@40:15](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=2415.15) \- **Madhur Makkar (RTP Ventures)**

Okay.

[@40:16](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=2416.03) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

So today this is the copy paste. This is what I would have done.

[@40:17](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=2417.95) \- **Madhur Makkar (RTP Ventures)**

Like, but I would have had to open multiple instances of 10 companies, copy paste the relevant information with point A to point B from one single call.

Yeah.

[@40:25](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=2425.69) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

Yes. What are the existing set of automations that already exist? You mentioned this granular to Zapier to Affinity. What are the other things that are already there?

[@40:34](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=2434.23) \- **Madhur Makkar (RTP Ventures)**

Oh, I think so. This is the only one for daily workflows that exists. Then there is, uh, one, one thing that we have internally where in a, if I'm, if I put that Chrome extension in, I don't use it personally, uh, which is when you're sourcing and you're going to different, different companies website, that Chrome extension would pull all of the data from different sources, LinkedIn employees, sourcing they'll Uh, similar.

similar. Web website traffic growth via the Chrome extension. You can take a call if this has to be added to affinity or not.

And from that, there's also a button to add this to affinity. So that also exists. But because I don't spend time doing that at all, it is worthless for me.

And worthless for everybody. This was an easy thing to do, hence we did it, but it was a low, low value, the internal kind of a thing.

And hence, no one really uses it.

[@41:29](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=2489.87) \- **Sidu Ponnappa (Realfast)**

Sorry, I'm just going to switch here briefly to a couple of other discovery questions, which are constraint oriented for us.

So IT constraints, right? Do you guys have the latitude to, for example, install flawed code and co-work on your laptops?

Or is there some compliance process that you would have to go through?

[@41:48](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=2508.17) \- **Madhur Makkar (RTP Ventures)**

It is installed? It is installed. not an issue.

[@41:51](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=2511.77) \- **Sidu Ponnappa (Realfast)**

Okay. Usage of those tools against your, your data, like the data and affinity, not an issue, not an issue.

**ACTION ITEM: Confirm IT/compliance for local Co-work w/ Affinity; update Sidu/Aakash \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=2578.9999)**

issue. Which is why, this is the easy part for us, we are not building a SaaS product, we don't build on our side, we build a host on your side, it's yours, it's your code, it's your data.

[@43:09](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=2589.47) \- **Madhur Makkar (RTP Ventures)**

So that, let me get back to you, I don't see any challenges, but let me get back to you.

[@43:15](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=2595.01) \- **Sidu Ponnappa (Realfast)**

Okay, I think those are the only two things, because those are the two avenues of attack we have. One is to start very simple with putting co-work on the desktop and then starting to automate the individual's workflows.

And the other one is for being doing quick builds to, for example, the nudge notification for, that's a quick build, we usually start in the matter of a day or two, then the bottleneck is actually getting it deployed and running within your environment.

Yeah.

[@43:40](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=2620.31) \- **Madhur Makkar (RTP Ventures)**

We'll know, we'll figure this piece out, should be possible, not, not last time, but if, if it is not letting it back to you, today, Okay, sorry, back to you, Aakash.

[@43:50](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=2630.97) \- **Sidu Ponnappa (Realfast)**

No, I think that actually uses everything that we need, really.

[@43:53](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=2633.51) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

It's a, like the first few sets are very straight forward. We just need to pick one and then go with it.

Yes. It's been that the nudge-based automation has the least amount of domain context that we need, something that can be independently tested and automated, so that piece is there, although that is not something which is going to run locally, running locally will be the affinity MCP based operations, where somehow you are able to basically add, like even for that matter, actually, there is an important delta between the two choices, Aakash, which is that we are blocked at least for some amount of time to qualify what it will take for us to host option option one.

[@44:35](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=2675.23) \- **Sidu Ponnappa (Realfast)**

But this we can start right now, assuming Madhur has time, tomorrow, day after, we can immediately start executing. That is highest velocity.

Yeah, can.

[@44:46](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=2686.13) \- **Madhur Makkar (RTP Ventures)**

Tomorrow was also half day in flight. So I have my first half also blocked, available.

[@44:53](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=2693.65) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

Yeah, so in that case, affinity MCP plus local cloud cloud code based operations is the new Thank

[@46:00](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=2760.01) \- **Madhur Makkar (RTP Ventures)**

11, 12, 1, all four slots of people.

[@46:02](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=2762.89) \- **Aakash Dharmadhikari**

I need to be in, sorry, Sidu, I have something personal tomorrow. can set it for one. One o'clock? Okay.

I'm good with that.

[@46:09](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=2769.61) \- **Sidu Ponnappa (Realfast)**

I think that's after EQT, you know, Steve? Sorry, sorry.

[@46:20](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=2780.13) \- **Steven Sule**

EQT is a 2.30. Okay. Okay. Then we're good. 1 to 2.30, two, can block, right? Yeah. All right.

[@46:29](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=2789.47) \- **Madhur Makkar (RTP Ventures)**

See you. Thanks. See you.

[@46:31](https://fathom.video/calls/577347522?timestamp=2791.97) \- **Steven Sule**

Bye-bye. All right.
