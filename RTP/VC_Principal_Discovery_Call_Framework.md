# VC Principal Discovery Call — Madhur Makkar, RTP Global

## Context

**Who**: Madhur Makkar — Early-stage Investor / Principal at RTP Global (Bengaluru)
**Relationship**: RTP is our investor. This is a collegial conversation, not a client pitch.
**Strategic goal**: Land and expand — unlock personal value for Madhur, then expand to RTP as a firm.

---

## Objective of the Call

**The goal is NOT to:**
- Pitch Exocortex or AI transformation
- Brainstorm high-level AI use cases
- Propose solutions before understanding reality

**The goal IS to:**
> Map Madhur's actual weekly operating model at the task level — surface the mundane, repetitive, low-leverage work that consumes time but doesn't drive investment returns. Identify 2–3 areas where we can build a quick-turnaround POC that delivers immediate, visible time savings.

**Key principle**: We are diagnosing, not selling. We earn the right to touch high-value workflows (deal screening, IC memos) by first proving we can eliminate operational friction.

---

## Trust Ladder — How Engagement Expands

This is a land-and-expand play. The trust ladder determines what POC we pursue.

```
Phase 3: INFRASTRUCTURE         IC memos, deal screening, diligence synthesis
         (earn this — 3-6 mo)   Career-defining outputs. High risk if AI gets it wrong.
                                Only gets here once he's a believer.

Phase 2: AUGMENTATION           Market research, comp analysis, landscape mapping
         (graduate to — 1-3 mo) Judgment-adjacent. He still makes the call, AI shapes inputs.

Phase 1: OPERATIONAL            Meeting prep, post-meeting notes, portfolio updates
         (start here)           Low risk. Visible daily time savings. Builds trust.

Phase 0: ADMIN                  Expense reports, CRM data entry, internal reporting,
         (ground floor)         travel logistics, document admin.
                                Zero risk. If AI messes up, nothing breaks.
```

**We are targeting Phase 0 and Phase 1 on this call.** Phase 2–3 come later.

## Pre-Call Hypotheses (Testable)

Based on Madhur's role as an early-stage principal in India:

| # | Hypothesis | Rationale | Validation question |
|---|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Internal reporting is a weekly tax** | Principals report pipeline activity, deal status, and meeting logs to partners. Repetitive structured output. | "Do you have to produce a weekly update for the partnership? How long does that take?" |
| 2 | **CRM / deal tracker hygiene is neglected** | Deal notes scattered across WhatsApp, email, Notion. Logging deals properly is admin overhead that slips. | "Where do your deal notes live today? When you need to pull up context on a deal from 2 months ago, how easy is that?" |
| 3 | **Pre-meeting prep is manual Googling** | Before founder calls, he researches the company, founder background, market context. This is 10–15 min per meeting, 5+ meetings/week. | "What does your prep look like before a founder meeting? How much time goes into that?" |

Enter the call with these. Let him confirm, redirect, or surface something better.

---

## Call Structure (25–30 minutes)

### Module 1 — Open Warm (2–3 min)

**Tone**: Collegial, not clinical. This is an investor relationship.

> "We've been thinking about how the platform we've built could actually be useful for you personally — not RTP as a firm, just your day-to-day. I'd love to understand where your time goes so I can figure out if there's something concrete we can build for you quickly."

Set the frame:
- This is about *him*, not the firm
- We want to *build* something, not just advise
- "Quickly" signals this isn't a 6-month engagement

---

### Module 2 — Map the Overhead (10–12 min)

We already know where his alpha is — deal evaluation, founder relationships, pattern recognition. **Don't map those.** Instead, map everything *around* the alpha work that drains time but doesn't drive returns.

**Focus areas** (the boring stuff):

1. **Reporting & internal updates** — weekly pipeline updates, partner summaries, deal status reports
2. **Data entry & tool maintenance** — CRM logging, deal tracker updates, tagging, filing notes
3. **Information retrieval** — re-reading threads for context, hunting across Slack/email/WhatsApp/Notion for deal details
4. **Post-meeting admin** — writing up notes, sending follow-ups, logging outcomes
5. **Pre-meeting prep** — Googling founders, pulling company context, checking prior interactions
6. **Document admin** — expense reports, travel logistics, NDAs, compliance paperwork
7. **Portfolio housekeeping** — reading company updates, extracting KPIs, consolidating data

For each area, probe:
- "How often does this happen — daily, weekly?"
- "How long does it take each time?"
- "Is it the same process every time, just different data?"
- "What happens if you skip it or do it late?"

**What we're building**: A map of his repetitive operational overhead — the tasks that are structured, frequent, and low-risk. These are our POC targets.

---

### Module 3 — Surface the Mundane (8–10 min)

This is the critical section. He'll naturally gravitate toward talking about deal evaluation and strategy. **Redirect to the boring stuff.** That's where the quick wins are.

**Questions to surface admin/bureaucratic overhead:**

> "What's the most annoying non-investment task you do every week — the stuff that has nothing to do with finding or evaluating deals but you still have to do?"

> "Do you have to produce a weekly or monthly update for the partnership? Walk me through how that gets done."

> "When a portfolio company sends you an update — via email or WhatsApp — what happens next? Do you have to do anything with that data?"

> "How do you track your deals right now? Is there a CRM, or is it more informal? How much time do you spend keeping that current?"

> "After a founder meeting, what's your process? Do you write notes somewhere? Send a follow-up?"

> "How do you handle expense reports and travel logistics? Is that on you or does someone else manage it?"

> "Last week, what specific task made you think 'I really shouldn't be spending time on this'?"

**What you're listening for:**

| Signal | What it means | POC opportunity |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| "I have to write a pipeline update every Friday" | Structured reporting overhead | Auto-generated weekly pipeline summary |
| "My deal notes are all over the place" | Information fragmentation | Unified deal intelligence layer |
| "I spend 15 min Googling before every call" | Manual meeting prep | Pre-meeting intelligence briefs |
| "Portfolio companies send updates and I just read them" | Update consolidation overhead | Auto-extract KPIs, flag anomalies |
| "Expense reports are annoying" | Pure admin friction | Expense automation / receipt processing |
| "I have to update Affinity/Airtable after every meeting" | CRM data entry tax | Auto-log meetings and notes to CRM |

---

### Module 4 — Identify Friction & Test Hypotheses (embedded in Module 3)

For each pain point that surfaces, apply the diagnostic filter:

- **Is this recurring?** (weekly/daily vs. occasional)
- **Is this structured?** (same process, different inputs)
- **Is this low-risk?** (if AI does it imperfectly, does anything break?)
- **Is it visible?** (will he notice the time savings immediately?)

Map onto the 2x2:

```
                 High ROI Impact    Low ROI Impact
High Time        STRATEGIC          OVERHEAD ZONE  ← Target these for POC
Low Time         EFFICIENT          NOISE
```

**Opportunity = High Time + Low ROI Impact.** That's the POC sweet spot.

---

### Module 5 — Close with Commitment (3–5 min)

Do NOT close with: "I'll come back with a structured perspective." That sounds like you're going away to write a deck.

**Close with a build commitment:**

> "Based on what you've told me, I think [specific POC] is the fastest path to showing you value. Here's what I'd need from you — [specific inputs: sample pipeline report / access to deal tracker / a few example portfolio updates]. We'll come back in two weeks with something working."

**Concrete, specific, time-bound.** He should leave the call knowing:
1. What you're building
2. What you need from him
3. When he'll see it

---

## Behavior Guidelines

**You are**: Calm, collegial, curious, structured. A portfolio company founder who respects his time and wants to help.

**You are NOT**: A vendor pitching. A consultant diagnosing. A solutioner jumping to AI.

**Rules:**
- Don't mention AI, automation, or tooling until he does or until the close
- Don't probe LP/fundraising or partner-level activities
- Don't assume scheduling is his problem (likely delegated)
- Don't propose high-value workflow changes (screening, memos) — those come later
- Do ground every question in a real, recent, specific moment
- Do let him talk — the best diagnostic data comes from his tangents

## Post-Call Internal Output

Immediately after the call, document:

1. **Weekly time map** — estimated hours per bucket
2. **Top 3 admin/operational drains** — the mundane stuff
3. **Top 3 high-value workflows** — for future phases (don't build these yet)
4. **What he cares about most** — the emotional friction point
5. **Recommended POC** — one specific build, with inputs, timeline, and expansion path
6. **What we need from him** — specific data/access to start building
7. **Trust ladder position** — where he is today and what moves him up

---

## Meta Goal

**Short term**: Build something in 2 weeks that saves Madhur 3–5 hours a week on work he doesn't enjoy.

**Medium term**: Once he's using it daily and says "this is genuinely useful," propose Phase 1 POCs that touch his actual investment workflow.

**Long term**: Madhur becomes the internal champion. "Hey, the thing Realfast built for me — we should roll this out to the whole team." That's the expand motion.

**How we earn it**: Not by pitching. Not by diagnosing. By building something fast that works, on the stuff nobody else thinks is worth automating.
