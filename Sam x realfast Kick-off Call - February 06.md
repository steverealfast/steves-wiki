[@0:00](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=0.0) \- **Nikhil Mannikar (Realfast)**

proud. Like when Namu is telling me I'm laughing, I'm smiling.

[@0:07](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=7.62) \- **Steven Sule**

I'm like, she's like, what's wrong with you? I'm like, dude, it's a rite of passage.

[@0:13](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=13.52) \- **Nikhil Mannikar (Realfast)**

Even if, even if he's getting stitches, he took it like a man. Growing up, my mom was just constantly worried about constant complaints coming in from everybody about me.

Always had both my knees, uh, cracked. Always. All the time. Knees?

[@0:40](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=40.48) \- **Steven Sule**

Yeah.

[@0:41](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=41.22) \- **Nikhil Mannikar (Realfast)**

Fall somewhere or do something. Oh, hey.

[@0:43](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=43.94) \- **Samuel Steele**

Hey, hi. Morning. How are you doing? Good. How are you doing? Good. Thank you. Good. Thank you. Awesome.

[@0:55](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=55.46) \- **Steven Sule**

Did the formality settle up? Yeah. All sorted. Oh, awesome. Cool. Yeah. you. Yeah. Awesome.

[@1:02](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=62.14) \- **Nikhil Mannikar (Realfast)**

So, uh, Sam, that's why we thought that, uh, we should just have a quick kickoff call to align on what the next steps and, uh, action items are for us, uh, just quickly recapping how we were stuck thinking about the first month milestone was to get started with the conversations, right?

Across the different channels that we have, uh, so that we can start quickly testing the market. Uh, so what we wanted to do today was, uh, be able to, in a position where, uh, you, we have clarity on what needs to be there, uh, ready for you to be able to start, uh, talking to people and start getting the calls, uh, set up.

Right. Uh, so towards that, uh, there, there were definitely a few things that we wanted to, for each of the channels, uh, sort of cash out with you, uh, in terms of, there are certain things that, uh, are playing out in terms of how our GTA motion is set up in Singapore and Southeast Asia.

Right. But the dynamics of the ANZ market, I'm sure there'll be some contextual nuances that we're not aware of.

So when you start talking to these folks, you would ideally want to have the right positioning, right messaging, so that it lands in that, in their context, right?

So what we wanted to do was for these two key channels.

[@2:23](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=143.4) \- **Samuel Steele**

Can you just hold on a sec? Really sorry. No worries, no worries. Sorry. Yeah, I'm back. I'm back. No worries.

No worries.

[@2:38](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=158.54) \- **Nikhil Mannikar (Realfast)**

So I wanted to break down the corner session by channel, which is one is the Salesforce, and then one is the direct to customer kind of a thing, right?

And for each channel, we had some questions, both sharing more context around where we are in our GTM maturity, for that channel, and discuss more open questions.

Questions around whatever that you have heard and listened so far in terms of how we are positioning, what our differentiation is, what will work in the market that we want to chase, Apart from the SMB Singapore where we currently have traction.

So that's how I wanted to structure the conversation. And from there, there'll be certain action items that will come out, right?

Does that at a high level make sense? Yeah, that at a high level makes sense.

[@3:28](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=208.22) \- **Samuel Steele**

I've jotted down some sort of thoughts as well in terms of what I can start doing and the sort of stuff that I probably need.

So yeah, let's just have a chat. You share with me where you think things are now and what the lessons are thus far.

And then I can go down my list of sort of things I'm thinking about kicking off, why I'm thinking about kicking them off, strategy, and then...

Yeah, some of the elements that I think I'll need to support that. Sure. Awesome.

[@4:06](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=246.34) \- **Nikhil Mannikar (Realfast)**

Yeah, I would love to hear more from you and how you're thinking about it. Just probably set the context for the Salesforce channel with the fact that whatever we are right now doing with this new financial year getting kicked in, and we already are, we have an actual call with the A's in a couple of, in a few hours, Singapore A's for the SMB market, where we sort of have had a couple of conversations already with the managers and we've aligned on what the KPIs that they are chasing, which is for them, what matters is the net new revenue, right?

For A's primarily, that is the primary goal, and that's 80%, 90% of their incentives, while for the managers, it's 70% is linked to retention.

So these are sort of two strategic objectives around which... Which we are putting our positioning right on how we will help them get there.

So I wanted to understand, and this is, I'm sure might be a global sort of trickle down of the KPIs, right?

But wanted to hear from you on, in ANZ, you had mentioned that SMB is where we should start from.

Do you have a sense on what are the key KPIs of the team that they are chasing, that we should be aware of, and try and align messaging around that?

[@5:40](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=340.26) \- **Samuel Steele**

I mean, what you've hit on there in terms of like, net new business and retention, it's the same. I think, I I don't who, so you're talking about the Singapore team, right?

Yeah.

[@5:55](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=355.34) \- **Steven Sule**

So if you think about the way Singapore is mapped out, it goes Vernon and then under Vernon. And you've got Angela.

And under Angela, you've got TechYang. So our predominant contact base is with TechYang. And his group of AEs that handle ESMB in Singapore are the ones that we are presenting to today.

And so from our conversations between him and Heather, who handles like, I think she's an SE or something. Heather Mao, yeah.

So between our conversations between them, we seem to understand that at Heather and TechYang's level, retention is a core factor as well as like trying to get more usage eventually of whatever Agentforce deals that they get done.

And on the AEs level, it's about net new revenue. And each of these AEs now have their territories mapped out.

So we expect that this is the push that they will start making, I guess, starting from next week, but then you have Chinese New Year.

And then you have like, then they'll start bringing in some of more of their deals. So around those two sides, we have devised, I think we had touched upon.

We've this before, A4X, which is, Nikhil, if you want to go into a little bit of detail about what A4X does, as well as our Jumpstart packages on Agentforce.

Both of those are supposed to be quick wins and be able to prove value to the customer about what the benefits of using Salesforce are.

Now, if that is a direction that you feel in the Oz market, we also need to go, or not, depending on how mature the Oz market is compared to Singapore and whether or not you actually need to go in with these lower value, high-win propositions, or whether you can start straightaway building more deeper relationships in terms of more customized implementations.

That's in your court. Yeah, it would be both.

[@7:43](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=463.64) \- **Samuel Steele**

Okay. In reality, I think one will not exclude the other based on the infancy of the conversations that we're going to be having.

So I think we want to approach it from all sides, really, not just both sides. So, I think Yeah.

And I mean, why don't I just drop down, like run down my thought nuggets that I jotted down this morning.

Sure. Yeah. Because then that may be, then we can riff off that. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. Sure. So what I've done is I've started to just pull down a list of all my contacts within Salesforce who are there, whether that be sort of pop top down, right?

So pulling that together. Company kickoff is next week, which you probably know. So a lot of the leaders won't be around.

The Agentforce World Tour for Sydney is on the 25th of February. Yeah. that's an opportunity to get involved. And then when I look at the target strategy, I'm sort of going, hey, like let's target a few targeted RVPs to begin with.

I was thinking kind of like a LinkedIn blast to. The AEs, top down, bottom up, just through my network and just say, hey, have you seen this real fast product?

Have you seen what they can do? These guys are doing this. And in order to do that, what I want or what I need is like a compelling demo or some sort of short video clip.

And in my mind, it's something similar to what we went through around the demo with... Yeah, Vinay. What's his name?

[@9:31](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=571.38) \- **Nikhil Mannikar (Realfast)**

Vinay, yeah. Vinay, Vinay, sorry, yeah.

[@9:33](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=573.92) \- **Samuel Steele**

Yes. And then also I want to meet with the sales programs team, the internal team who drives the pipe gen internally and see whether there's something we can package up there.

Now, this is obviously early stage and then meeting with my tech brains trusts within Salesforce to get... Their thoughts as well on the best positioning based on what they're doing.

So that's kind of my kickoff focus areas, right, for this month, let's say. But what I need for that, again, brain dump, I need that compelling demo of some sort that I can use.

I need a clarity on the status of what your implementation partner authority is and what you're like, are you signed up as a global implementation partner, are you just Asia, are you Singapore, do you have, who are your partner managers, because it'd be good to maybe connect with them.

I'd like, I'm not going too deep. And then a bit of the price listing commercial model clarity around what the levers are that we can pull and push when the right thing comes up.

know those starter packs are there. starter packs are probably the best place to start in any of these conversations.

That are, hey, look. We can get this use case, this use case, this use case done with a level of confidence and it'll cost $10,000, $15,000, whatever.

Yeah, and then a better understanding of what your engagement model actually looks like when we're talking about going to the customers.

Because, like, I've seen stuff on LinkedIn and I saw Sidhu posting stuff around, like, what Claude Code is doing and then what Realfast is doing.

And ultimately, I think he's posted something like it's not, like, we're not doing it 100% now, but it's coming.

So I just, there's all these things that we need to tighten up a bit such that I can start putting things out there.

[@11:49](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=709.321) \- **Steven Sule**

Just on your question on partner, manager, do you know Eugene? Eugene is the ball.

[@11:59](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=719.521) \- **Samuel Steele**

Eugene is

[@12:00](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=720.001) \- **Steven Sule**

So he's been our main point contact for the last year. I'm guessing he handles a lot of our partner relationship networks in Singapore.

I mean, I know there'll be somebody different if we, once we get to Oz, they will have somebody else there that will probably be doing the same job.

But for now, it's Eugene. And fully aligned with what you're saying in terms of our delivery mechanism, how we operate specifically along, a lot of customers, as they're more mature, they get questions around like whether or not their data is exposed to Claude and things like that.

So all of those things, we have all of that information. And as in when those questions come up, we can deal with them, as well as our collateral that we can share.

[@12:50](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=770.241) \- **Samuel Steele**

Yeah, I think the level at which you can get me up to speed on that as well, or at least give me access to it, helps with the talking points.

Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. I probably won't go to it, go through it in a heap of detail, but at the level that I'll be flying for the time being, it's good to know.

[@13:09](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=789.321) \- **Nikhil Mannikar (Realfast)**

Sure. Sure. So the demo is something that I think we are there already. Maybe it'll need a bit more editing to make it more sharper, sharper, short form kind of a thing.

So we'll come up with that variant. I'll share with you.

[@13:26](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=806.381) \- **Steven Sule**

Hang on, Nikhil, just before you go on, I think after we do today's demo, which will be recorded with the AEs, what we're doing.

So we will send you a video link of that so you can observe real time how our comms are with AEs in sync and how the value proposition.

So then you can then flex that narrative according to the way it would work, which will be more culturally appropriate to your market.

[@13:49](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=829.061) \- **Samuel Steele**

Yeah, for sure, for sure, and I'm assuming, presumably, you may still want me to push into some of the Singapore market, so we'll just stick with it.

I'm going to be careful as Well, like now that I know that you're talking to like Heather was one of the people that I was going to, I probably would have pinged had it been like going to the AE level of things.

She's quite strategic.

[@14:14](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=854.022) \- **Steven Sule**

So in Singapore, I think that we're on the ESMB side, I think we're well entrenched, right? I mean, for sure, we would love to start moving conversations slightly higher up the value chain as well, whether we can move to mid market or not.

And because we have had sort of a longstanding relationship with Heather, simply because we've done a bunch of work for her on some of her strategic accounts, we haven't actually felt that opening come up from her side yet, where she's willing to take us to sort of larger customers.

And I don't know whether that's still her sussing us out or not, but she's also, I think, on maternity leave at the moment.

So that's a bit, that's not going to move very much in the next couple of months.

[@14:57](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=897.142) \- **Nikhil Mannikar (Realfast)**

But what would be interesting, Sam, there is, uh, The champion, honestly, for ESMB, from a DFLOW perspective, is the sales manager, TechYank, right?

From a core platform and all of those other SKUs perspective as well. And that's something that we'll see how we pan out.

But on top of that, like, for example, you were talking about Vernon, right? Now, does Vernon only, what is the span of control for Vernon, for example?

Is that if we sort of start building more engagement and touchpoint with somebody like Vernon, does that open up opportunity for us to go upmarket from SMB to mid-market and sort of bigger, bigger deal?

[@15:37](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=937.502) \- **Samuel Steele**

Yeah, sure. I mean, if you get, like, and that's, that's the thing, like, we want to make sure we've got something cleanly packaged and a little bit sense check before taking it directly to Vernon.

And I could bounce some stuff off him as a friend, but I want to, like, I'm reluctant to do that at an early stage because I think if we can take the wow factor with something that's...

It's bit more proven, whatever that looks like. It'll be great. Also, you just need to be careful, like, what Techian's doing in terms of maybe he's doing some sense checking.

Maybe he knows about the – Vernon might know already that the conversations are happening, but he's not diving into it.

And then there are other people outside of Vernon's team that we can start talking to once we know clearly, a value proposition map, for want of a better term.

Like, you've got the value here based on this challenge or opportunity. You've got the value here based on this challenge and opportunity.

And this is how we help you do – well, help you get new logos or new business and how we help you retain your current customers or grow what the customer base is doing because we can do this with the tool to assess the code, analyze, and give recommendations or upsell whatever new capability based on it.

No discovery meeting or something to upsell. And then there's the, hey, we've got this brand new customer that comes through ES\&B or mid-market.

It's a referral or it's however it comes through. We want to have a discovery call. We need to work out what the mechanisms are then to plug you guys into a discovery call with the right customers to then show, hey.

And if I've said this to you already, I apologize. But actually, no, this is one of my questions because you take the back-end componentry where you are spinning up a demo org, right, in that demo.

Yeah. And it's coming straight off the text from the discovery meeting. With a demo org, and this is testing my recollection of the detail of the demo org, but if there's a new potential customer, anyone can spin up a demo org.

go. Or can they have access to a demo? I'm just trying to remember what needs to be in place, what's the happy path for executing that demo for a customer and giving them the ability to go in and play with that demo or instance if that is possible.

So then it converting to a license sale with an attached Fathom, that's like, that's the visual like journey I think we need to like, I'd love for you to document that says like discovery call, demo, immediately spun up demo org based on the need for the customer.

Provide that to the customer through a login because it's in our demo environment that they can go in and have a play around with it.

Feedback loop to the AE, then the next steps are kind of fast following. If this works, then order form and fast start, packaged up.

Like that's a journey that we can clearly communicate. Now it's not going to obviously be happy path all the time.

There'll be all sorts of questions, but if we can start to articulate that end to end, then that's the sort of thing you can also take to a leader and say, hey, we've got an idea.

We're one of your implementation partners. We'd love to do like a little joint program with you guys where we package this up for a discounted 5K for anyone who signs up in the next two months.

And do you want to run that with your A's? That's the sort of thing you can take to Vernon.

[@19:53](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=1193.82) \- **Steven Sule**

So then what you mentioned on the last part, so you're saying that the 5K offering would be... A end-to-end implementation of a fast start package as a discount offering for a couple of months to be able to attract new businesses.

that the way I'm saying it? Yeah. Yeah.

[@20:13](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=1213.06) \- **Samuel Steele**

Potentially. Potentially. That's the core process. Yeah.

[@20:17](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=1217.92) \- **Nikhil Mannikar (Realfast)**

Absolutely. So, I mean, I'll share the collaterals with you, right? That we are going to use on the call with the A today and share the link as Steve said.

But just to the point that you mentioned, we would map out for specifically these kind of startup packs or even otherwise, right?

What is the typical process in terms of how we deliver? That would be mapped out. But as you said, just to cover quickly, with the tooling that we have, that is precisely the happy path that you mentioned is actually the delivery process and methodology that we use, right?

We will be using where we would, based on the industry and space of the customer, we would already. We have a template for discovery questions right and we will share that with the AE as well and if we are on the call with the AE objective is run that questionnaire with the customer on the call very specifically post the call based on the call itself that question starts getting filled up right and that feeds into the solutioning sort of workflow that we have that you also saw right where now that transfers as an input to the agent.

to then start building out a solution and then we sort of the approach is to iterate like maybe twice or thrice with the customer have very fast tight iteration loops so that in day two itself first the customer sees what was discussed and then from there we go in a couple of iterations to say that I need more this was not covered all of that and from there then we sort of lock it in and sort of go on launch right so that's that's the way we want to accelerate that entire thing.

So ideally on day two, they should be able to see a demo based on the context that they have shared, their data, their requirements, their problems being solved on Salesforce.

So that's the motion that we want to run ideally. But yeah, we can track that out further in terms of the deal cycle if needed.

If you want to zoom in on any specific parts there, we'd love to hear your feedback. And that's the kind of honestly the feedback that we want, right?

But just wanted to get a sense check. This is some, this is in line with what you're saying, right?

This is something that we would map out.

[@22:36](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=1356.2) \- **Steven Sule**

I think just before you answer Sam, I think that one question that Sam did have is that when you talk about handover, handoff on day two, does the client actually get access to play with the demo real time so that they can actually see the functionality before they iterate back to you?

Or is it again, just an artifact of a video or some kind of flow chart that they give? think that isn't that the specifics you were asking for, Sam?

. . . .

[@23:00](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=1380.0) \- **Samuel Steele**

I think that's the, like, that's the, what we need to look at here is, like, what are the differentiators and what are the, like, golden moments?

Like, if you can, if we can say we can do something that is unlike anything that's been done before, based on this new capability, that's what we really want to double down on.

Absolutely.

[@23:21](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=1401.4) \- **Steven Sule**

So just, just for context here, Sam, and I'm going to jump a little bit to, uh, off Salesforce, what we've been doing with, uh, NUS in Singapore and with another client in the, in the Oz region, is that when we are working with them on, uh, a particular automation or a particular workflow that they want, uh, made more efficient, in the morning, we will have a stand-up with them where they give us the feedback from the night before of whatever it is that they have used, uh, and how they find the, the, the, the of tooling working for them.

And then by evening, we have another, uh, sort of email and, uh, demo org sent.

[@25:00](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=1500.0) \- **Nikhil Mannikar (Realfast)**

That's what we are doing. So, yeah, it will be an hands-on access that they'll get, not process flows. Of course, those are something that we'll, anyway, that we can sort of share with them.

But yeah, idea is in two days, they should be able to get a hands-on access to the system.

[@25:17](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=1517.56) \- **Samuel Steele**

Hands-on access to a demo org that they can play around with, yes. A demo org that is, where does the demo org instance sit?

[@25:30](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=1530.24) \- **Nikhil Mannikar (Realfast)**

So, that will be an SDO org that we have. And, but we can figure that out in terms of if they have, with the A's as well, right?

On how we want to navigate that to give them that access. That's something that we'll have to sort out.

But from right now, what we're doing is set up an demo org in our SDO org. That's, that's currently what we are doing.

your own org. Yeah.

[@25:53](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=1553.16) \- **Samuel Steele**

Yeah. So, they could give you some dummy data to use and you can set something up and say, hey, this is how quick.

It's playbook Basically, we can get it up and running for you. If you decide to go with Salesforce, this is like our little pre-sales bang, here you go.

The A gets to see the fact that you've built that and it's got the functionality that has been agreed as a pre-sales activity.

Then the next step is, hey, great, sign an order form, get this, spin up your own org, and then real fast we'll come in and do that process.

You were just showing? Yeah, yes. This is what I'm trying to articulate in my head is I think it might be helpful to make it clear on what the pre-sales jazz is to give to the selling team as a hook of magic that they probably haven't seen before.

For as a sales team to get them to think, oh, wow, actually, instead of getting off a discovery call and just say, hey, I'm going to follow up with my customer in a week with what did you think of the discovery call?

Well, I'm actually going to be able to give to them a demo org built based on what they specifically told me and them not having to pay anything yet to get that demo org and they can go in and play around and see how Salesforce will do, I don't know, 20, 30, 50, 80% of what they said in their discovery call and that's how quickly it can be spun up.

That's the special source, I think. And that's a different, yeah, from the actual sales motion or the signature with the implementation magic.

Also coming afterwards, so it's, I think you, I think you get what I'm saying. For me, something like that would be impactful, and if you can articulate it well to the seller, that, that's when you get something, you might get a different response than probably, and I don't want to give you too much feedback now, because I'm assuming you're going to use these slides now, go to talk to the team, but that slide that you had up was a little bit the same as like, sure, the times are a little bit shorter, maybe, but that's the same as many, what many implementation partners might say.

Got it.

[@28:40](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=1720.06) \- **Nikhil Mannikar (Realfast)**

Okay, so what you're saying, yeah, fair, we need to sort of separate out these two things in terms of the pre sales, I think, and then what happens after signing and increases the part of the time component that needs to come out on how we're accelerating from

Discovery 2 actually showing a live, not a hands-on demo to the customers, so that that sort of accelerates the deal cycle, that that needs to come out better.

That's, is that right?

[@29:12](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=1752.84) \- **Samuel Steele**

Yeah, showing that to the sales guys, this is how we help you accelerate your deal cycle, because we can give you a demo org that has got functionality specific to them based on the feedback that they gave in that call very quickly.

Sure. Yeah. And then you are also showcasing the pace at which your technology can spin up an org in a demo org, nonetheless, but you're showing that, hey, with this implementation partner, Mr.

ABC Incorporated, if you go with us, and if you look to contract with Realfast as well, this is how quickly they can.

Get it up. You probably heard in the market that implementations with Salesforce can take weeks or months. Now we've got this, which is much quicker and leveraging the AI technology and their own specific Salesforce underpin schema, which is also a differentiator such that they can spin things up quickly using these AI coding agents.

[@30:25](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=1825.16) \- **Nikhil Mannikar (Realfast)**

Absolutely. Yeah, fair. I think, yeah, we have some time, honestly, I'll sort of go back and see what we can do the tweaks based on what you mentioned.

But yeah, I got the point. But honestly, you're right. In the sense, the point of the demo is to also exactly make a point that the sooner you show proof to the customer, faster you reach the point of customer building conviction to move ahead.

Right? And that's what closes the deals faster. So that's what we that's the core anchor point of the narrative that we'll be playing.

But on this point, I just wanted to come back to one question that we also discussed before, is that when we go to a new market like ANZ, what is it that will make the AI start giving us the deal flow?

Because they'll all have existing SI partners and all of that. So just wanted to get a sense check again on what else is the dynamics in play and what you see, saw and heard so far, is that enough for them to make that switch or what other nuances commercially or otherwise that you think are important based on your understanding of that market, what SI's are offering and all of that.

[@31:45](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=1905.7) \- **Samuel Steele**

Now, I might be totally off track, but for me, and if I am, then I've made the wrong assumptions, but for me, the focus is on the special source around the speed and this is why I keep, okay.

The differentiator is if unlike any other provider in the market now or that people have seen, and maybe there are people out there doing it, but unlike what's happened previously where an implementation takes forever and a sales executive is there going, far out.

I know I want to get this deal across the line, but I also know I'm going have to talk to an implementation partner and they're going to come back with a quote that's like twice the bill that I'm trying to give the customer for the licensing and they're going to say it's going to be two to six months and then I'm like, okay, well, I'm going to hold back that conversation as long as possible because I don't want to have it because it's going to double, triple the cost to the actual customer.

Worst case scenario is what I'm saying here, right? But if you can go and say, hey, Mr. AE. We have the proven solution that using this, not solution, have this proven approach that will help fast track.

And that's why you can't go super complex, I don't think, from the outset, because this wedge is getting into the more simple end of town, which is why I've gone for the smaller elements.

It's like, you want to spin up a CRM, you want to be tracking your customer base relatively simply, for example, or there's a bit of service.

Oh, you didn't say, did you say you don't do service? You do service? We do, we do. Marketing, yeah.

So you want to spin something up, and then here it is. Have this conversation and just go through that flow that I said just then, right?

That's the differentiator as far as I see it, because you don't want to be going in and just having a conversation and say, hey, we're real fast.

We're... We're another implementation partner.

That I can't take to the Aussie market, right?

[@34:09](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=2049.14) \- **Samuel Steele**

We need to do this fast leading, we are the, based on the experience that we've had and all of this stuff we've done and the relationship we've had with Salesforce previously, we've spent the last X number of months or years understanding the detailed architecture and infrastructure.

underneath and we've built this black box that does all of that and now you're plugging the coding tools and we can do it really fast.

Then, look, I'm still getting, like, I'm testing out the narrative here as well because I need to be able to talk it really well and you guys need to be able to push back on me and say, hey, actually, we can't do that.

So don't say that because as soon as we can't do what we say we can't do, we'll fall down off the bat.

So that's, I feel. But that's the opportunity across all markets.

[@35:07](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=2107.95) \- **Nikhil Mannikar (Realfast)**

Got it.

[@35:09](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=2109.19) \- **Samuel Steele**

And if I was to assess the potential differences within the Aussie market, my assessment would be where less, the market here will be less risk-averse to trying this than, Singapore slash some of the Asia markets.

Got it.

[@35:36](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=2136.47) \- **Nikhil Mannikar (Realfast)**

And the reason for that is?

[@35:40](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=2140.33) \- **Samuel Steele**

Just the nature of business and... Aussie culture. Culture, yeah. Yeah, we're so low to that and we'll just give it a go.

Word is bond, as long as as is long go. as as as you're you're For grey area in the market?

[@36:03](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=2163.89) \- **Steven Sule**

Sure.

[@36:05](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=2165.61) \- **Samuel Steele**

Doesn't need to be binary black and white. as long as it's set up and saying, hey, we think we can do 80% of this, but it's going to speed it up so much more, then people will be more willing to give it a go.

And that relationship between customers and AEs is a different relationship in some cases. Anyway, it's just more risk-taking. Yeah, yeah.

[@36:33](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=2193.27) \- **Nikhil Mannikar (Realfast)**

And we'll have enough checks in the demo that you see and when things actually pan out, right? That the quality doesn't get sort of compromised and we'll need to fix the messaging around that pass doesn't mean trading of quality, right?

Because that would be one of the factors.

[@36:53](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=2213.63) \- **Samuel Steele**

Yeah, yeah, 100%. You need to address all of that, right? Like, it's like, it's going to recursive. The model where it will just like, if something's wrong, it'll keep, it'll fix, it'll fix, it'll fix, it'll fix, it'll it'll Like the model does the UAT and the testing and does all of the functional testing.

And it's like, that's all done behind the scenes. So, yeah, yeah.

[@37:15](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=2235.31) \- **Nikhil Mannikar (Realfast)**

I mean, some of these markers as we go, we'll, and also as you sort of test that messaging out, as you were also saying that, what are the typical objections that A also have seen, you guys have seen with customers thinking about, then we will need to refine the messaging accordingly.

But I think on the Salesforce side, I think we're more or less covered. So just recapping, what we'll do is that you have already mapped a set of folks that you want to start reaching out to both bottom-up, top-down.

**ACTION ITEM: Email Sam Salesforce deck \+ AE recording link \+ short demo \+ AI transformation pack; request review/feedback \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=2259.9999)**

We leave aside the SMB part of Singapore specifically and look at the other segment. And from our side to be able for you to drive those conversations, I'll share the demo as well as the deck.

which covers the overall value offering as well as what is the commercial offering in terms of our starter packs, price points, et cetera, et cetera, and the way we will engage with the customers.

So all of that package I'll share across with you. Yeah, and we'd love to hear then in terms of any kind of refinement you think we need to do before reaching out so that we can have a quick nutrition cycle on that and then run with it.

So that's pretty much then we can run with. Yeah, I think let's send it over.

[@38:35](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=2315.81) \- **Samuel Steele**

We'll see how many iterations we need to go through before we start putting stuff out there. But yeah, think directionally that's the right way to do it.

Sure. All right. Great.

[@38:48](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=2328.83) \- **Nikhil Mannikar (Realfast)**

If that's good, then I wanted to spend some time on the end customer as a channel as well, right?

And Steve sort of talked about an example, but I wanted to... So to break that down a bit because it's slightly different than the typical startup pack end of a motion that we're trying to crank up with Salesforce on the customer side, honestly, the ticket sizes would be bigger, but the overall pitch also is around AI transformation right there.

And just to set a bit more context and feel free to jump in here, the core trigger that we're seeing in most of the boardrooms and executives, right, is that the AI mandate is there, but the blocker currently is that the stakeholders, which actually have to execute on stuff, right, for them to build that political capital internally, if they have two options, either you sort of build a roadmap, of that AI transformation, which runs into months.

And then you go into conversations of trying to show mathematically what the ROI looks like, and sort of initiative

[@40:03](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=2403.19) \- **Steven Sule**

It's basically endless discovery, right? I think that the whole concept or the vagueness of what is AI transformation at a board level sounds really good.

And then there's usually some amount of budget that gets allocated to what is AI transformation. Now, if there is not a particular metric or a particular process that you are looking to either save cost on or make more efficient, it becomes very difficult.

And what Nikhil says ends up happening, which is a six-month roadmap. Nobody really gets paid, nothing gets done. And then at the end of the KPI period, it's like, oh, we have nothing really to show for it.

AI transformation is . So what we've realized, and we have some concrete examples of this, is that with NUS, for example, we had a friendly relationship with NUS Enterprise, which is an offshoot of NUS.

And what we basically did for them is that we were in touch with a business process owner. So with the finance department specifically, and he then passed us down to one particular Thank you

moved on to procurement. What can we do with the procurement offering? So typically, it works in a way that one of our engineers sits and observes the way that they're currently doing the processes, and then we pick out chunks of that and automate it or augment it and connect it with the underlying data to make it more efficient.

And so we feel that that's a really simple way of being able to prove ROI to the end customer, specifically if, and the bottleneck here now is finding the right persona within a company that owns a mandate and has some amount of POC budget to be able to allow us to build and demonstrate what we can do, rather than this be an ambiguous, open-ended task of saying, we can come in and do AI transformation for you.

So that, in a nutshell, is how our operating model around of Salesforce works. On Salesforce is pretty simple, right?

Because the underlying platform is where you have your world to operate within. Of Salesforce, because the world is your oyster, it's so vast that if you don't have an entry point or like a persona to have an entry point, it becomes very difficult to sort of

Build that ROI use case. Okay, so this is, all right.

[@43:05](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=2585.17) \- **Samuel Steele**

Thank you for clarifying that because when you were saying off Salesforce, I thought you meant outside of the Salesforce selling corporation and into the Salesforce customer base.

But what you're actually saying is.

[@43:21](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=2601.81) \- **Steven Sule**

We are not restricted to Salesforce.

[@43:24](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=2604.11) \- **Samuel Steele**

AI transformation in any organization, whether or not they have Salesforce or not. Correct? Yes, that's correct. That's correct. All right.

On that example then. Yep. Because like I'm also doing, I'm doing work with other companies who are looking at this type of stuff, right?

Yep. Tell me, I've got 15 minutes and I've got to jump on another call with one of them. Like as a client, not as someone doing what you're doing.

What? Through that flow, what was the. What Thank What was the solution and how was it implemented? Was it like agents in between existing technology?

Was it data interpretation or reading contracts?

[@44:10](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=2650.21) \- **Steven Sule**

Nikhil, want to go into a little bit detail of like how the NUS case was built up?

[@44:13](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=2653.69) \- **Nikhil Mannikar (Realfast)**

Yeah, it was basically just a use case was processing contracts, right? They have a peak period in which the volume of contracts that they need to, their team needs to process sort of goes beyond the capacity.

So there is always a chock-a-block kind of a scenario that plays out there. So what the system does is you have all the contracts in place.

So we've mapped out the manual workflows that they currently have like literally validating certain fields and checkpoints manually. That sort of is done completely automated way.

Then it flags out these are the gaps and these are the sources of data points from where you can fill in those gaps, right?

So that entire process is end-to-end sort of automated. Okay. So what it took them sort of two to three hours is now done in sort of minutes, right?

That's the workflow. It's a small workflow, but it's sort of taking up 95% of automation of that particular workflow, right?

[@45:15](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=2715.09) \- **Samuel Steele**

Yeah, yeah. Which is awesome. Like they're the sorts of cases that are all over the place because they're they're time consuming, but they're not like there may be one individual doing stuff for an annoying amount of time.

Yes.

[@45:29](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=2729.33) \- **Steven Sule**

And so if you extrapolate that layer outwards, right, then you automatically get, think about it from a just in time or sort of like a assembly line production line.

You increase efficiencies, little bits across the board, net, net across the entire workflow. Now you've got a time crunch and an efficiency crunch that allows you to do more important things like focus your decision, focus your like mental capacity on decision making as opposed to doing all of this stuff that can be automated.

Having said that, I think that one of the key factors. Actors that we sort of like double down on was that we understood from our friendly that there is a particular budget that's available for POCs where we didn't have to go through like a three-month procurement cycle.

Had we gone in there and said that, listen, we will do your entire finance team's automation and build out an AI transformation platform for them, it would have been like, okay, now this goes into tender, this goes into like procurement, what are you actually going to do?

Everyone loses time and nothing gets built in those three months. So what we did is that we found the wedge where like the POC budget was already pre-approved and it was a small budget, was 15K SGD, right?

We went in there, we sort of put in our bid for like 14K so there was no drama with like any of the procurement teams flagging up like why is this closer to 15?

It just passed through, we were able to amazingly give them the results that they wanted and now that we're moving on to the second conversation where now procurement is getting involved with the larger transformation piece, the business owner that actually owns the piece has come back to us and said, listen, here's another small chunk.

I'm ready to move on to the next one. Just do the POC for me while we wait for procurement to come back for the larger piece.

So it's automatically moving in that cycle in a way where the end user who has the ability to write the check is so satisfied that they continually want to make the improvements that they've seen.

[@47:16](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=2836.39) \- **Samuel Steele**

Yeah. Okay. I mean, yeah, I've got a use case that I'm thinking of right now in one of my other customers.

But I could give it to you now as a bit of homework. Yep.

[@47:32](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=2852.75) \- **Steven Sule**

Sure. Okay.

[@47:34](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=2854.23) \- **Samuel Steele**

So high level. This is like a recruitment company in the aged care space. It's a bunch of stuff that happens in Australia around aged care and nursing companies need.

There are recruitment agencies that sit between like aged care homes and contractors, ultimately. Right. So this company is onboarding candidates.

Candidates as a backlog of nurses to then deploy into the contracts that they've won across the aged care home space.

They have a flow that when you obviously you get a candidate, they come through, you have to vet them, check them, talk to them.

And then there's a list of compliance documents that need to be checked. Like, do they have like their nursing degree?

Do they have their qualifications? Have they got certain vaccines? Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And that's a very time-consuming manual activity at the moment.

And then once all that's been picked and sorted out, they can move on. Now that challenge is something that they spend ages on at the moment.

And they're wondering whether that's something that can be automated. And then further down the track with ship management, there's a bunch of ship management providers.

**ACTION ITEM: Draft aged-care recruitment compliance POC workflow; send to Sam for review \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=2934.9999)**

There's a bunch of like applicant tracking providers, but there's no one end-to-end great solution. So what I'm talking to them about it is like, what can, what things can be put in the...

Are to plug it or what new technology decisions do you need to make?

[@49:05](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=2945.29) \- **Steven Sule**

I'm pretty sure without getting somebody from one of our FDEs to have a look at this, I'm pretty sure that this is something we can do.

If there's any way you can share without the name or anything, just some of the context that you just shared, I mean, we'll go through this recording and pull all the relevant information from this and be able to come up with some kind of a workflow for you.

But if there is some additional info you can share with us, that'd be great. And then maybe we can get something back to you early next week.

Yeah. Either we'll come back to you with like, yeah, this is something we can do or this is something we, or this is how we would do it.

And, or this is not something that's within our wheelhouse. so that you would get an answer pretty quickly.

[@49:46](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=2986.67) \- **Samuel Steele**

Okay. Yeah. Let me see. I've got a working session with them early next week. So I can see what additional information I can get and maybe give you like a couple of bullet points on what the flow would look like for you doing.

mean, based off what.

[@50:00](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=3000.01) \- **Steven Sule**

What said today, maybe we will try and just put together what our understanding of it is so that you can like have a look at it over the weekend and just say like, yep, you guys are like in the right wheelhouse and then we can come up with a sort of framework for how we would work with the solution without any additional information from you.

And then that looks appealing to them and to you, then we can open up that conversation and go forward.

Okay.

[@50:21](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=3021.27) \- **Samuel Steele**

Sounds good. Yep.

[@50:24](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=3024.17) \- **Steven Sule**

Sure.

[@50:25](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=3025.01) \- **Nikhil Mannikar (Realfast)**

Just on that point, Sam, coming back to what Steve was mentioning. But what you're saying is that they are actively sort of looking to solve this and, uh, that's something that they have budget around to actually get, get it going.

Right. Yeah.

[@50:40](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=3040.89) \- **Samuel Steele**

Perfect. Perfect.

[@50:42](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=3042.25) \- **Nikhil Mannikar (Realfast)**

Got it. Yeah. Uh, I mean, yeah. Uh, if there are more such customers, uh, we'd love to see, uh, coming back to that point, right, wherever we think there is either time or cost savings, because that has a direct impact.

Right, and a very specific, smaller use case, which doesn't require like. The huge time drag, that's something that we can really pick up and expand out of there.

So even on that, I mean, there's heaps of friends around.

[@51:11](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=3071.41) \- **Samuel Steele**

Like once I get a better understanding of everything you guys do, I'm sure it will unlock other ideas.

[@51:20](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=3080.69) \- **Nikhil Mannikar (Realfast)**

Sure. Yeah. Precisely on that point, I was going to say that I also share some of the pointers or material around the AI transformation, how we do it.

How we're looking at the use cases, what the pitch is, all of that as well. So that you have that as a ready reference point, slightly different from what we do at Salesforce Channel, but I'll share that as well.

So that we definitely want to point was to get even those conversations going, because then that takes the Salesforce sort of thing.

It opens up more channels, right, for us. So yeah, would love to start getting that going as well as soon as possible.

[@51:56](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=3116.95) \- **Samuel Steele**

Yeah, totally makes sense.

[@52:00](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=3120.51) \- **Nikhil Mannikar (Realfast)**

Awesome. think with that, we are covered on everything. Anything else that you had in mind?

[@52:10](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=3130.73) \- **Samuel Steele**

No, I think that's covered off. If you can get through those examples, the recordings and the recording of the meeting you have with the Salesforce guys, that'll be helpful for me to look through.

And maybe we set up like a standing call every maybe weekly. Yeah, yeah.

[@52:31](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=3151.23) \- **Steven Sule**

I think, yeah.

[@52:32](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=3152.73) \- **Nikhil Mannikar (Realfast)**

Sounds good. I'll set that up for the next week. So the objective there would be ideally by then we should have had the feedback or iteration baked in based on once you go through consume the material that we share and have a list of ultra friendlies maybe or friendlies that we can go and test this out.

I've got a list, which is, yeah.

[@53:00](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=3180.01) \- **Samuel Steele**

We need to know what we're going to send before we engage. absolutely. Yeah, that's the urgency on my side as well.

Can we do Wednesday, like Wednesday weekly? Yeah, we can do Wednesday weekly.

[@53:19](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=3199.53) \- **Nikhil Mannikar (Realfast)**

Perfect. Sounds good.

[@53:20](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=3200.65) \- **Samuel Steele**

I'll say that. All right.

[@53:22](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=3202.97) \- **Nikhil Mannikar (Realfast)**

Just one thing was to tell you that after today's call, we'll get to hear more from the Salesforce folks, and we are planning to be there in Singapore in the first week of March, physically, me, Steve and a couple of other folks as well with there.

So we are actually going to be planning out who all do we meet there. So the timing would be perfect.

So we can plan that out as well beyond people that we actually know, if there's anyone else that we can meet up, right?

I'd love to map that out as well. Next time we meet, we'd love to go through that. Cool.

[@53:57](https://fathom.video/calls/557237242?timestamp=3237.21) \- **Samuel Steele**
